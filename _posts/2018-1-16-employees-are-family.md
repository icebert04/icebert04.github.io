![Employees Are Family](/images/Ise.jpg)

Employees are not loyal anymore. Some look for greener pastures but most of them are not properly managed by their employers. What I mean is that majority of reasons why employees quit their job are under the control of the employer. Although is not the fault of the Boss entirely but they can do something about it to make their employee think twice before leaving their company.   

I was raised in a family were I saw that their staff, employees, katiwala (trusted helper), driver, gardener, cook, labandera (one who does the laundry), and other servants stayed and have been loyal to my Grandmother and my Mother in our province in Balayan, Batangas.
