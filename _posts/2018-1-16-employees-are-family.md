![Employees Are Family](/images/Ise.jpg)

Employees are not loyal anymore. Some look for greener pastures but most of them are not properly managed by their employers. What I mean is that majority of reasons why employees quit their job are under the control of the employer. Although is not the fault of the Boss entirely but they can do something about it to make their employee think twice before leaving their company.   

I was raised in a family were I saw that their staff, employees, katiwala (trusted helper), driver, gardener, cook, labandera (one who does the laundry), and other servants stayed and have been loyal to my Grandmother and my Mother in our province in Balayan, Batangas.

One thing that made this effective was the proximity. Laborers live just a few minutes away from my family's residence. Our workers get to see their family everyday. They don't work long hours and most important of all... they are happy!   
Maybe that is one of the reason why maids in Manila or in big cities leave their boss (or Amo) very early in their stay. They simply just miss their families in their province.
So that is one factor... Proximity. Make sure that you're employees are living near their families or better yet bring their families to them... especially if you feel that the employees is worth keeping.
