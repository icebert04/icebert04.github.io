Where the hell is Suriname? Is it a country? Or the hottest restaurant in town? I wouldn't have known until this girl (in the picture) came along. Her ancestors came from that place and yes... SURINAME IS  A COUNTRY!

Suriname is the smallest country in South America with a population less than 600,000 (5% of Metro Manila's population).   
Despite its small size, Suriname is one of the worlds most ethnically diverse countries. No group forms a majority, and yet there is very little ethnic tension between them. The largest group are the East Indians, followed by Maroons, Creoles, Javenese, Chinese, Levantines and Jews.   
This is a legacy of centuries of Dutch rule, which entailed successive periods of forced, contracted, or voluntary migration by various nationalities and ethnic groups from around the world.
