Where the hell is Suriname? Is it a country? Or the hottest restaurant in town? I wouldn't have known until this girl (in the picture) came along. Her ancestors came from that place and yes... SURINAME IS  A COUNTRY!

Suriname is the smallest country in South America with a population less than 600,000 (5% of Metro Manila's population).
