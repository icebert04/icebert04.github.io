What is your weekend look like? Stay in Manila or Head out to Tagaytay? Tagaytay is considered to be the "**Second Summer capital of the Philippines**" with the first being Baguio due to its cool climate thus is a favored destination from those relatively more humid areas of the Philippines.   
With an average elevation of 2,000 feet, the popular place has become probably the most visited area on the weekend. 

Most urban dwellers visit the city as a reason for escape on their everyday busy life. They drive to Tagaytay normally to dine and unwind. It's a perfect getaway!

Me, on the other hand, wants to shake things a little. Dining is fine but sooner or later you will run out of restuarants to go to. Believe me, I'v been passing through Tagaytay for most part of my life and I've been to several places... and sometimes it gets boring.

So I did the "**Unthinkable**"! I searched, asked, and looked for relatives, friends, even enemies who are living in Tagaytay. Most of this property owners wouldn't mind me coming over to their place. In fact, they might be even be pleased to pay them a visit.   
Another good thing is you don't need to rush when you eat out since the owner of the house is somebody that you know of. In other words, you can stay as long as you want.

One of my first visit is my Tito Ray. He is the 1st cousin of my Mom. They were able to purchase a lot in Tagaytay and constructed a cute but well organized bungalow house. It is like 2 container van in the property but it is made out of cement.   
The 2 container van type of house are formed like an "L" shape. The 1st house consist of 2 bedroom with a big lanai in front. This is perfect for guests coming over where they can chat and eat all day  and all night long. 

The 2nd house is mostly for cooking but it can also converted in a guest room. But when guests do a "Sleepover". They can just lie and sleep on the lanai and enjoy Tagaytay's cool weather.   
There is also a small garden for Frisbee and outdoor games. When there is no guests, the garden is used for parking area.

I normally visit this place whenever I travel alone to my province in Balayan Batangas. I go to Tito Ray's house as a Pit Stop.... or should I say like a "**Refueling Stop**"!
