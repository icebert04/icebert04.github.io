What is your weekend look like? Stay in Manila or Head out to Tagaytay? Tagaytay is considered to be the "**Second Summer capital of the Philippines**" with the first being Baguio due to its cool climate thus is a favored destination from those relatively more humid areas of the Philippines.   
With an average elevation of 2,000 feet, the popular place has become probably the most visited area on the weekend. 

Most urban dwellers visit the city as a reason for escape on their everyday busy life. They drive to Tagaytay normally to dine and unwind. It's a perfect getaway!

Me, on the other hand, wants to shake things a little. Dining is fine but sooner or later you will run out of restuarants to go to. Believe me, I'v been passing through Tagaytay for most entire of my life and I've been to several places... and sometimes it gets boring.
