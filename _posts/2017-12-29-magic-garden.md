Each one of us should have a personal sanctuary. A shrine to take away all your stress. A place for you to unwind and ponder on your whole being.   
Most people assume that to achieve this you need to book a flight to fascinating places like Paro Taktsang monastery in Bhutan, the Wulingyuan Scenic Area in China, or the dreamlike island in French Polynesia.

But no, you don't need to go out of your home to obtain this. All you need is a little space of your home, a little bit of creativity and Presto... you got yourself your very own sanctuary.
