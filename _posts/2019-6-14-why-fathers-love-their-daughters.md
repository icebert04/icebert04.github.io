In a few days from now, it's going to be Father's Day.   
All of us will be honoring our father and celebrating & thanking them for all the good things they have given us.

But what is the definition of being a Father really?   
Are they meant to be providers? Is having the tag name "Man of the House" gives them the sole authority to be the only disciplinarian in the family?   
Can anybody be a father even if they don't bear any biological offspring?  

The definition of a Father is not only traditional and one dimensional. Through the years, a Father figure has evolved in multiple ways.   
But the only thing that remains the same is a Father's love for his children.   
A Father who will Sacrifice everything (even up to his last breath) to give anything for their kids. 

We have heard a lot of stories about why a Father become a Hero to their sons and daughters. Each one unique and special especially if it comes from you or your own family.

Well, I got one of my own. And this person is not in my family circle or a relative of mine. I just met him a few months ago here in Manila.

His name is Koji. He lives in Sanda, Hyogo, Japan.   
It's about an hour drive from Osaka. 
He is happily married with 4 girls and 2 boys.   
Koji's earns a living through Permaculture and Carpentry. He makes good money from both that he never ran out of clients.   
He even showed me a picture of his own house that is 90% made of wood (Sorry, he has no FB account and no pictures to show).   
Koji and his family never have to buy vegetables and fruits in the supermarket since they have an organic farm in their backyard.   
They are the ideal blessed family. They all lived a Happy life in Japan.

But recently, Koji notices one thing is missing.   
Even with Japan's strong economic status, they still lack one thing... most of the Japanese don't know how to speak ENGLISH.   
They have good schools, Yes. But that's about it.   
These kids don't practice their English when they are out of their school premises.

Koji realized that something must be done. Both Koji and his wife doesn't speak English too, so how on earth can their kids learn this new language that is direly needed in this day and age to be competitive and successful in both in their career and personal lives. 

So Koji sacrificed his marvelous career and beautiful home for the sake of his children. 
In 2015, Koji and all members of his family migrated to the Philippines for one purpose only... to learn English.   
The plan is to enroll their kids for 3 consecutive years to learn not only the English language but also get to know Philippine culture. 

They choose Dumaguete because it is a small and quiet town. The place has some excellent schools too, so it fits their needs entirely.   
During their 3 year stint in that province, Koji rented a house and bought a motorcycle with a sidecar attached on it (like a tricycle) as their means of transportation to school (kinda like a school bus).   
For 3 years, Koji has to live eating up all his savings just to send all his kids to school. The hardworking Father from Japan has to do odd jobs in Dumaguete just to keep them afloat.

Every summer, Koji brings his family to Siquijor for 1 month so that they can enjoy the beach and the sun.   
"We have to stay in the Philippines for 3 years, so we must take advantage of it while we were at it" quoted Koji.   
It's all about Sacrifice for Koji, that he will endure loneliness and weariness just to see all his children smiling and happy.   
We never get to hear these kinds of stories, do we?

At present, Koji and family are now back in Japan. 
They have returned to their lovely home. The family is back planting organic produce again.
Koji got most of his clients back and it recuperating his once depleted wallet. 
Happy ending for Koji right... Not, there are more stories to tell. More sacrifices for Koji. 

Just this year, Koji had to bring his daughter "Mio" back to the Philippines for another tour. This time, it is just him and his daughter. The rest of the family stayed put in Japan.

We should be hearing complaints from Koji this time around but no, he went on his ways and did everything for his daughter.
Koji is what I can say a "Sacrificial Lamb" for the family. 
It is just in his nature to yield everything for the sake of those who are in need. 

Koji's second trip to the Philippines is where I met him and his daughter Mio. During our brief stint with these 2 Japanese tourists, I notice something special. 
Of all of Koji's 6 children, Mio is the favorite. 
Everything that Mio asked, she then receives. Mio's father is her buddy. They are very close to one another. 

In Japan, Mio is the only one who is helping her father with all of the carpentry works. As proof, Mio built her own wooden garden-house all by herself.
Mio also assists her father when they make new garden beds for their vegetables.  
They are always together. Their bond is so strong and inseparable. 

I got to talk to both Koji and Mio. And believe me, they are really special. They are kind, sincere to the feelings of others, noticeably simple and yes... they know now how to speak English. 
They are not just Father and Daughter. They are like Best friends. We don't see that often in a relationship, do we?

Daughters need great Fathers. It would be nearly impossible to overstate the importance of the father-daughter relationship. It plays a vital role in every girl's journey to adulthood.
A Father creates a Gold standard for future romantic relationships. As they get older, their daughters pick mates who have similar attributes to their father.

All daughters will eventually grow up and marry the man of their dreams. But all of them won't forget their father, who has been instrumental in their foundational lives. 

Mio will also mature and marry a handsome and kind Japanese guy. And they will live happily ever after.
But somewhere along the way, Mio will pay a visit to her Dad.
The father who has been the "Sacrificial Lamb". The father who risks everything for her. 
For Mio, her Father is forever her "First and Most Influential Love"!
