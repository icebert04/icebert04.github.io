![PWD](/images/Paul.jpg)

I remember this perfectly.... I was with these 2 guys buying stuff for my sister's wake in WalterMart Makati. And when I was about to pay at the cashier, I noticed that the line was full (about 20 people ahead of me). So I said to myself "Tough Luck Francis, just go with it!"

Then I saw one of my guys named Paul who is also about to pay for the merchandise that he pick in the mall. Just when I thought that he will lined-up after me, he went to a different lane that I didn't know it exist. He went to the Express Lane. 

So after wasting 1 hour in the line and finally reaching the cashier. I went to Paul after and ask him... "How did you do that?" And this is what he said to me... "PWD ako Kuya!"

PWD is an abbreviation and short term for Persons With Disabilities. Here in the Philippines, as of January 2017, There are an estimated 1.2 million PWDs in the Philippines. But, only 50,0000 PWD cardholders are taking advantage of the benefits, says Senator Sonny Angara. 

I was intrigued by it and Google it and was amazed with its benefits and priveleges. Here's what PWDs are entitled to...
