![PWD](/images/Paul.jpg)

I remember this perfectly.... I was with these 2 guys buying stuff for my sister's wake in WalterMart Makati. And when I was about to pay at the cashier, I noticed that the line was full (about 20 people ahead of me). So I said to myself "Tough Luck Francis, just go with it!"

Then I saw one of my guys named Paul who is also about to pay for the merchandise that he pick in the mall. Just when I thought that he will lined-up after me, he went to a different lane that I didn't know it exist. He went to the Express Lane. 

So after wasting 1 hour in the line and finally reaching the cashier. I went to Paul after and ask him... "How did you do that?" And this is what he said to me... "PWD ako Kuya!"

PWD is an abbreviation and short term for Persons With Disabilities. Here in the Philippines, as of January 2017, There are an estimated 1.2 million PWDs in the Philippines. But, only 50,0000 PWD cardholders are taking advantage of the benefits, says Senator Sonny Angara. 

I was intrigued by it and Google it and was amazed with its benefits and priveleges. Here's what PWDs are entitled to...

20% discount and VAT exemption

=> Hotels, Restaurants and Recreation centers 
=> Theaters & Cinema, Concerts, Carnivals, and other similar places of culture, leisure and amusement
=> Medicine, Medical & Dental services
=> Domestic air & Sea travel
=> Public railways, skyways, and other public utility vehicles (including buses, jeeps, taxis and shuttle services)
=> Funeral and Burial services for the death of the PWD

5% discount

=> Basic Necessities such as: 
Rice, Bread, Fish, Fresh pork, beef and poultry, as well as Veggies 
    
=> Prime Commodities such as: 
Fresh fruits, dried or processed or canned pork, and Dairy products

Other benefits

=> Educational assistance to pursue primary (nursery and kindergarten), secondary, tertiary, post-tertiary, as well as vocational or technical education, in both public and private schools, provided the PWD meets admission requirements
=> Continuance of the same benefits and privileges given by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), Social Security System (SSS), and Pag-IBIG 
=> Express lanes for PWD in all commercial and government establishments (if none, priority shall be given)
    
In some cities there offer...

=> 3 hours Free Parking for PWDs in Cebu City
=> Free Movie admission in Quezon City


So what's the big fuss about it???

Well, my youngest son Lorenzo was born with Autism and we where not aware that he can have this certain benefits and priveleges.... and he is turning 13 next year.
I too was born with a certain condition and also qualified to get a PWD card from the goevernment... and I'm 40ish old. 

If we knew this, we have received and used this priveleged and benefits a long time ago. Awareness is the key. If Paul did not line up in that Express Lane, I wouldn't have known.

That is the purpose of Friendillion, ladies and gents. The more people that you know that more possibilities and awareness you will be receiving.
