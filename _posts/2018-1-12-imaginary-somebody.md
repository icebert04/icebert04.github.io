People were born Greedy! All of us have a "Overwhelming Desire for More"! We are always never content with what we have. Buy another car even if we have three, rack them all the ladies shoes and buy some more, and eat all the food that you want like there is no tomorrow.

I too have that same negative trait... the longing for those I didn't have. Although I am not into material things, there is still something I always crave for... A Baby Girl! 

Don't get me wrong, I am very happy and delighted that I am blessed with a loving wife and 2 handsome boys. Life is really good! But why is that I still look for a Baby Girl?   
Maybe my family (Isberto side), bear more sons than daughters. My Grandfather has 4 sons, My Dad has only me, and I have 2 boys. Did you see the pattern? That is 7 dudes in 3 generations... where did the girls go?

I did try (to have a Girl) but obviously the results is not as promising like what I've dream of.

Luckily, I accidentally had those what I call "Imaginary Somebody". Someone who is not yours but you can pretend that somewhat it is real. I had the luxury to have not only 1 but 3 Imaginary Somebody through the course of my married life.   
Let's start with the first...

1.) GIRL NO. 1 (SPAGHETTI GIRL) = Her name is Cheri. A cousin of my wife who grew up in our hometown in Batangas. I treated her not as like a daughter but more of a little sister because our age gap is not that big (more than 10 years).   
I remember Cheri before were she used to dance along with her other cousins to the song "Spaghetti" Pababa of the infamous disbanded group Sexbomb Girls. This charming girl would dance on the cemented road barefooted all throughout the morning.   
Then her Dad will call her since it is past 12 noon. Cheri would eat her lunch as fast as possible then would rush out again to dance the rest of the afternoon.   
Cheri is now 26 years old, working as a Finance assistant in a Multinational company. She now have big responsibilities but we do see each other in Batangas during holidays and special occasions.

2.) GIRL NO. 2 (MY INAANAK) = Inaanak is Goddaughter in English. Kristine or Tin-Tin is my wife's goddaugher so in essence Tin-Tin is also my Inaanak. I met Tin-Tin even before having my first born son. She is such doll and we often "Borrow" that cute little girl from her parents and bring her in our home in Manila. This is where I experience that girls are more sweeter than boys to their parents (especially to their fathers).   
I was always amazed about Tin-Tin's dresses, shoes, shoulder bags, and most especially her headbands ponytails, hairclips and pigtails. 
But I knew that Tin-Tin is not mine so I observed from afar and gave her some space especially now that is she is 18 and madly in love with her boyfriend.
