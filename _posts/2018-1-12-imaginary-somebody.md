![Imaginary Somebody](/images/Casey.jpg)

People were born Greedy! All of us have a "Overwhelming Desire for More"! We are always never content with what we have. Buy another car even if we have three, rack them all the ladies shoes and buy some more, and eat all the food that you want like there is no tomorrow.

I too have that same negative trait... the longing for those I didn't have. Although I am not into material things, there is still something I always crave for... A Baby Girl! 

Don't get me wrong, I am very happy and delighted that I am blessed with a loving wife and 2 handsome boys. Life is really good! But why is that I still look for a Baby Girl?   
Maybe my family (Isberto side), bear more sons than daughters. My Grandfather has 4 sons, My Dad has only me, and I have 2 boys. Did you see the pattern? That is 7 dudes in 3 generations... where did the girls go?

I did try (to have a Girl) but obviously the results is not as promising like what I've dream of.

Luckily, I accidentally had those what I call "Imaginary Somebody". Someone who is not yours but you can pretend that somewhat it is real. I had the luxury to have not only 1 but 3 Imaginary Somebody through the course of my married life.
