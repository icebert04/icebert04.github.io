My Dead Sister has been gone for more than 6 months but it feels like it is still fresh just yesterday. I just counldn't believe that my baby sister is taken away from us.   
During the wake, I had the time to observe all the people who gave their respect to my sister. From my sister's relatives, close friends, classmates, workmates.... each and every one of them I observe carefully and studied their behavior.

One thing that really caught my eye is this lady from Antipolo. Her name is Rose and classmate of my deceased sister (Roberta) in St. Paul Q.C. Rose was there with my sister from the time Roberta was rushed to the hospital, the entire duration of my sister's wake, the 9th and 40th day and even up today.   
Rose was there for my sister even before my Roberta got sick. That makes her the Official Bestfriend.

Roberta was born as the sweetest person in our family. I really don't know why but I think she is the youngest and everybody protected her like somekind of a antique dinnerware.   
Our mother spoiled her rotten and gave everything she could ask for. Her 3 Kuyas (me included) are the last line of defense. And it will take a courage of a lion to have the audacity of visiting our baby sister.   
My sister had Bestfriends during her time in CSA (Collegio De San Agustin). We come to know them and even became close to her group.   
But when my Mom died 7 years ago. Roberta's group of friends became untraceable and grew by the numbers. She got friends from the city, from the province, and almost everythere that I is so hard to  keep track.

One of them was Rose. At that time I taught Rose was a bad influence to my sister. Primarily known as the Strict and Unforgiving Kuya, I told Roberta to stay away from Rose.   
But as days passed, I come to know the person whom my sister officially tagged as her best friend.   
During my sister's "Darkest Days", Rose was there to lift my sister's emotion. Rose was basically available 24/7 for my sister. Rose was emotionally supportive and always have her back in time of need.

Rose is a type of friend that didn't make my sister's problem disappear but Rose is the type who won't disappear when my sister has problems. They travelled together, spent multiple sleep over together and drank, cooked and laughed together. 

Rose is not the showy type and brag her "Bestfriend Tag" during the wake. She just stayed behind the limelight and let other people visit my sister's remains. And when she is all alone with my sister, that is the time she makes her grief and sit down beside my sister.
And when Rose is crying that is the time that it hurt me the most. I feel her pain! Her lost! But she kept quiet. She kept her distance. And cried when nobody is watching.

It's hard to continue life without the sweetest person in the planet. My sister was my number fan whenever I create a project online. Roberta and I always communicate through Social Media and through I got the courage to say "I Love You" to the people that I love.   
And now that she is gone, I have nobody to share my ideas with. I won't get inspiring songs from her beautiful and charming voice. That Black Hole will forever remain with me. 

But as the saying goes, life must go on. Rose is my inspiration nowadays whenever I want to remember my dead sister. I checked Rose's newsfeed regularly and imagine that my sister is there with her in all of her post.   
Like that time when Rose climbed General Nakar. I imagined that Roberta was with her. Rigidrously laughing together, drinking tequila or vodka while strumming the guitar singing their favorite hymes.  

Through Rose actions, I feel my sister being alive again. Like the action and adventures never stopped. 

To my Dead Sister Roberta... I like to take this opportunity to say "I Love You". I miss you! Your voice, your messages, and your cheeky bone smile!   
Thanks for being there for me. You will still continue to inspire me and use my god given talent to the fullest.

To the Official Bestfriend Rose... If ever you are reading this. In behalf of my family, we like to give our extreme gratitude for being there for my sister. Please continue what you are doing. The wackiness, the drunkenness, and all the crazy thing that you and Roberta had been doing when she was still alive. 

For sure, that will make Roberta smile!
