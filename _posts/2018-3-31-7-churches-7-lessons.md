Visita Iglesia is a tradition where people visits at least 7 different churches on Holy Thursday & Good Friday. It is one of the most popular Holy Week panatas, or sacred vows, that Filipino Catholics make.

So I did my research on Google Maps and look for popular churches in Metro Manila. Although there are beatiful and famous churches in the city, I just don't wanna go there just for the sake of it.   
Plus, the popular ones are the most crowded so I did more research... until I found my 7 churches.   
The objective is to get 7 churches that will give significance and moral lesson to me and my family. 

So here are my 7 Churches and the 7 Lessons that we learned from it...

1.) **REMEMBER THE DEAD, PRAY FOR THE LIVING** (St. John Bosco Parish, Makati)   
=> This church has been the Funeral chapel for our dearly daparted (Martinez Family). This place gives us a lot of reason the remember them. The happy times together and why we will always cherish them forever.   
We also prayed for the living. Especially the troubled and those who are in need of God's guidance.

2.) **WHY PEOPLE ARE BAD?** (San Ildefonso Parish, near Pasay)   
=> The chruch is near Pasay City. In the past, Pasay was known as the country's “sin city” because of the proliferation of prostitution dens masquerading as nightclubs and bars. High criminality rate was also recorded during that time.   
We prayed and ask guidance to the Lord to shelter us from evil but more importantly to try to understand them as to Why are they made that way. There must be reason for it.

3.) **SHED SOME OF YOUR RICHES TO THE POOR** (St. Alphonsus Mary de Liguori Parish, Makati)   
=> This parish is beside Magallanes Village. It's an exclusive residential developement for the rich and elite. So we went there not only to give thanks for all the blessings that we received but also to ask God to enlighten the others (especially those who are really rich) to shed more of their money to strangers. It they do that, it will be for their own good.

4.) **FIND YOUR TALENTS AND USE THEM** (St. Joseph Parish, Bamboo Organ, Las Pinas)   
=> This place is renowned to house the Bamboo Organ, a pipe organ made mostly with bamboo pipes. Music enthusiast often visit to see the talented musicians plays the bamboo pipes.   
They are not the only ones who has the talent. Each one of us do too.   
If you don't know your talents yet, ask God, and please use it and share it to the world.
