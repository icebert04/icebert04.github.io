Dear Son,

Soon, you will get bigger and taller and will be a full-fledge grown-up. Your interest will drastically change from playing game console & computer games to meeting pretty and fine looking girls.   
Your life will be most centered on the opposite sex. You will be looking at their beautiful faces in their social media accounts. You will be calling them on the phone and their voice is the only thing that you want to hear to complete your day.   
Believe me, I too was that during my bachelor years. Women are like "Heroin and Bullets". They get so heavenly addictive but will make you bleed (in sorrow) whenever they feel like it.   
It really pains you that you don't know who is the right girl for you....   
That is why you should be dating first!

Dating is a form of romantic courtship typically between two individuals with the aim of assessing the other's suitability as a partner in an intimate relationship or as a spouse. The result of dating may at any time lead to friendship, any level of intimate relationship, marriage, or no relation at all.
