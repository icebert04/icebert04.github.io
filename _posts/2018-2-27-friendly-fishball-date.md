Dear Son,

Soon, you will get bigger & taller and will be a full-fledge grown-up. Your interest will drastically change from playing game consoles & computer games to meeting pretty & fine looking girls.   
Your life will be most centered on the opposite sex. You will be looking at their beautiful faces on their social media accounts. You will be calling them on the phone and their voice is the only thing that you want to hear to complete your day.   
Believe me, I too was like that during my bachelor years. Women are like "**Heroin and Bullets**". They get so heavenly addictive but will make you bleed (in sorrow) whenever they change their mind and when they feel like it.   
It will really torture you that you will go asking yourself who is the right girl for you.  
That is why.... you should be dating first!

Dating is a form of romantic courtship typically between two individuals with the aim of assessing the other's suitability as a partner in an intimate relationship or as a spouse. The result of dating may at any time lead to friendship, any level of intimate relationship, marriage, or no relation at all.   
My advice is this... when you see a girl that is interesting, you should not bring her to a romantic and intimate date yet but rather go for a friendlier kind of date... like a cup of coffee, walking the dog at the park or eating fishball.

Yes, try the Fishball first. Bring your date to the streets and observe how she reacts to it. Will she back off? Or will she immediately get a stick and make "**Tusok-Tusok the Fishball**" as soon as she sees one?   
If she does loves it, that means that she's a keeper! It means she can ride the jeepneys & tricycles. It means that it's totally okay for her to go on just window shopping.   
It means that she is not choosy and will totally be happy wherever you go... as long as she is with you.

After that, you can go ahead and advance to a more extravagant and upscale dates for as many as you want. She totally deserves it (even if it is highway robbery). It just proves what kind of personality your date has. Her parents could be influential on who she is today. Your date has good upbringing and that my son is very wife material.

If you think she is the hottest woman in the world, but hates to learn and read.... **So long, Farewell, Adieu**!   
An attractive, affluent person, but tramples on other's dignity.... **Bye Bitch**!   
But if you do meet a person who is sincere, sweet and charming... you are in good position to potentially marry someone who will not give you a headache for the rest of your adult life.   
I don't care if she is rich or poor, brown, tan, or white, a good cook or not....   
What I am looking for is a woman who will genuinely likes you for who you are. Someone who shares your values. And someone who will love you unconditionally and makes you a better man.

If you ask me, it wouldn't hurt if she is pretty (someone who will give me attractive & adorable apos). I would like that she gets along with your immediate family and friends. She shouldnâ€™t be critical of the people who you love and have been loyal to you throughout your life. She can have some bad habits & traits and all, but in general, she should be a good fit with the people in your life. Marriage is a joining of two lives that existed prior to meeting the other person.

But it is just me, your daddy, who sometimes expects the moon and stars. You can't blame me you know... after all you are my son and I love you so much and I always want you to have the moon and the stars.... The whole universe if I have to. 

So go ahead and go on friendly fishball dates. Date as many girls as want. Get to know them. Because one day there will come a time that you will meet a person that will make you say.... "God, I wanna go on a enchanting fishball dates with her for the rest of my life"! 

Your sentimental & idealistic father,

Francis (a.k.a. Daddy)
