Dear Son,

Soon, you will get bigger and taller and will be a full-fledge grown-up. Your interest will drastically change from playing game console & computer games to meeting pretty and fine looking girls.   
Your life will be most centered on the opposite sex. You will be looking at their beautiful faces in their social media accounts. You will be calling them on the phone and their voice is the only thing that you want to hear to complete your day.   
Believe me, I too was that during my bachelor years. Women are like "Heroin and Bullets". They get so heavenly addictive but will make you bleed (in sorrow) whenever they feel like it.   
It really pains you that you don't know who is the right girl for you....   
That is why you should be dating first!

Dating is a form of romantic courtship typically between two individuals with the aim of assessing the other's suitability as a partner in an intimate relationship or as a spouse. The result of dating may at any time lead to friendship, any level of intimate relationship, marriage, or no relation at all.   
My advice is this... when you see a girl that is interesting, you should not bring her to a romantic and intimate date yet but rather go for a friendlier kind of date... like a cup of coffee, walking the dog at the park or eating fishball.

Yes, try the Fishball first. Bring your date to the streets and observe how she reacts to it. Will she back off? Or will she immediately get a stick and make "Tusok-Tusok the Fishball" as soon as she sees one?   
If she does loves it, that means that she's a keeper! It means she can ride the jeepneys & tricycles. It means that it's totally okay for her to go on just window shopping. It means that she is not choosy and will totally be happy... as long as she is with you.

After that, you can go ahead and advance to a more extravagant and upscale dates for as many as you want. She totally deserves it (even if it is highway robbery). It just proves what kind of personality your date has. Her parents could be influential on who she is today. Your date has good upbringing and that my son is very wife material.

I mean, if you see a girl who doesn't mind mingling with the affluent and the rich but also who can hug the poorest of the poor. If you do meet a person like that... you are in good position to potentially marry someone who will not give you a headache for the rest of your adult life.   
I don't care if she is rich or poor, brown skin or white skin, blah..   
What I am looking for is a woman who is genuinely likes you for who you are. Someone
