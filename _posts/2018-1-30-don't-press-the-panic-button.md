![Panic Button](/images/Pandin Lake 2.jpg)

What would you do if you are swimming in the middle of the ocean and you start to have muscle leg cramps? How will you react when people start to run out of the movie theater because of the fire? 
How can you stop a your car in a highway when you suddenly found out that you lost your brakes?

Panic happens to everyone especially when it is their first time to experience it. It cloudens the mind that prevent you from any logical thinking. It is a sudden sensation of fear that causes bad decision like mass stampede and even death.

My Father thought me how to overcome it. When I was little, my Dad uses to bring all the time to the beach of Matabungkay in Lian Batangas. We always travel in a big group and always take the Balsa (a small raft or boat made from bamboo sticks). We then hook up the Balsa in the deepest water then swim from there.   
I, at that time, don't know how to swim. But my Father always bring me to the open sea and I try to swim (head above water)somehow towards him who is seating comfortably in the Balsa. Did it work?..... Yes! I was able to overthrown my fear and became a good swimmer. 

I know now how to survived if a boat sinks in the middle of the ocean. Even if I have muscle leg cramps... all I need to do is massage my leg gently even when I am submerge in the water. Go up to take some oxygen then repeat the procedure again until you are able to take away the cramps.

In the past, when I go out on a date for a movie. I always position ourselves near the Fire Exit. We still take the best seat as much as possible but I always make sure that we are quite near to the Fire Exit. Why? Because when there is a Fire... people first reaction is to run out when they came in the first place. It initiates Crowd Rush and Human Stampede that leads to severe injuries and even death.   
But if you are position near the Fire Exit... you can easily get out of the theater and most of the time you go along with a very small crowd.
