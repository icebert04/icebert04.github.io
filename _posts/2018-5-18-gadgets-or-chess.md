Gadget or Chess? What do you like to play? Most kids will make the obvious choice but little did they know that even though they are quite entertaining.. they are falling for a big trap!   
Thses gadgets (Smartphones, PCs and iPads do cause harm in so many ways like.... Addiction, Distraction, Shortened Attention Spans, Reduced Reading, Lack of Exercise, Disrupted Sleep, Damaged Eyesight, Radiation, and many more.

I must say it's time to "**Rethink Their Wisdom**"! In comes the game of Chess!   
This popular game goes way way back in the Gupta Empire. Unfortunately, kids of this day and age have forgetten this board game or even worst didn't know it exist.

I always make it point to let my children knows how important this game is and what benefits they will be getting from it. Chess can do a lot of things to kids and adults alike. It can Raise your IQ Level, Sharpen Your Memory, Teaches Planning and Foresight, Teaches Creativity, Promotes Abstract Thinking, Develops Patience & Thoughtfullness,
