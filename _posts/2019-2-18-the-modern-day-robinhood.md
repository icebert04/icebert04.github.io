![Robinhood](/images/Meryl 5.jpg)

The world we lived in is composed of people who are fixated primarily on one thing... **"Their Own Benefit"**!   
It's all about "Me" or "I" or "Us" rather than "We or "You" or "Them".   
We, people, have evolved into **"Selfish Beings"** with self-centeredness, egocentricity, and egoism all attached to our belt.   
The **"Me Always First"** attitude had made everyone more lonely as ever. Putting up a wall between others and oneself, thus creating disharmony, separation, and anxiety.

Why can't we be like most influential people (fictitious or not) like Santa Claus, who brings joy to kids and child at heart who made a big impact even to this day and age. 
Or Ludwig van Beethoven, who probably was the most predominant figure in the Classical and Romantic eras, making people learn to love music rather than hate & war. 
Or Robinhood, who risks his own life every day to give alms and food to the poor and the needy. 

Now, all of these individuals that I've mentioned have extremely philanthropic characteristics. 
Never in my wildest dreams that I imagine myself meeting someone like them.... not in my lifetime, at least.

If I do meet someone like Santa Claus or Robinhood in this day and age... that person should probably be the heir to the King of some country or a Monk who took a vacation from Nepal. 
I never envision seeing a legendary person like that underneath our very own roof. 
Yes, I found the "Modern Day Robinhood"... and she is my little sister.

My little sister "Meryl" was born unhesitatingly taking the crown away from me. After being the Prince in the family for 12 years, my sister took away my royalty headband and became everybody's favorite. 
And since my sister was an adorable little creature... I had to hide my desolation and pass the crown (not to mention privilege) to her.

As Meryl grew older, I'd noticed some unique traits that nobody has. 
The kind of characteristics that the folklore outlaw turned to hero had. 
Meryl is the type of person who makes sacrifices not only to the people that she loves but also to strangers... making her The Modern Day Robinhood.  

My little sister has helped the security guards that she never met before. Gave food to the Barangay street cleaners. And even supported a child (who has no relation whatsoever) for his educational needs. 
Meryl has the most list of Christmas gifts making our Family Christmas tree surrounded with small item gifts (where the item's monetary value is below 100 pesos). We have to get a big box just to put all her gifts in there.

She gives, gives, and give without asking anything in return. Never posted her kindness act on Facebook or other social media sites. She just keeps quiet and does here thing... looking for the next victim. Victim of receiving gifts and grants from her.

If you think I am exaggerating, you can "Friend Request" my little sister on Facebook. Then ask help from her by saying your sad story and the next thing you know she is on her way following your request.

Whether we admit it or not, most of us are culprit of being self- centered creeps. We may not notice it at first but it is who we are.
In modern society, being self-centered protects lonely people in the short term. But in the long term, the harmful effects of loneliness build up over time. 

I am not suggesting that we should be like my little sister doing "Robinhood Acts" all year long. All I am advising is we open up a little bit. Show a little bit of heart. Give more and receive less. Try talking to strangers (they don't bite).

Show and demonstrate a little bit of this and a little bit of that. 
It will not only make a contribution to our society but it will also make a big impact on your life. 
A deeper purpose and endless rewards for a lifetime. 

Meryl has been living that Happy Life. She is a hero that won everybody's hearts.
