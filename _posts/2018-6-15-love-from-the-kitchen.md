All of us are loved by the people close to us. We undeniably aborb that love and affection from our **"Immediate Family"**. It is because our own human existence is so dependent on the help of others that our need for love lies at the very foundation of our existence.

Things get pretty shallow outside of our Immediate Family circle. We got back-stabbing relatives, ex-friends and ex-lovers, hypocrite co-workers, etc.   
Only seldom we see and hear stories of extra-ordinary love from strangers and outsider. 

Mine started from the kitchen. Ka-Ising (Felicia Manalo) is her name. She works as **"The Cook"** for my Lola in a 10 hectare property in Balayan Batangas.
