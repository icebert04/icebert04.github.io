In life one thing remains certain... Death, Taxes and the San Antonio Spurs!   

The Spurs have been the NBA's best-run franchise for the past 20 years, and no other team has even come close. San Antonio has experienced an unparallelled level of sustained success, and has done so with nothing but class.

They are known with excellent coaching with Head Coach Gregg Popovich who has 5 champioship rings. They got great scouting from discovering foreign players like Argentina's Manu Ginobili and France's Tony Parker.   
And most important of all the Spurs have extreme "**Chemistry & Loyalty**"!

One good example comes from their Superstar Tim Duncan who in the past have the option to leave the team and join the upcoming Orland Magic with a massive salary but choose to stay with Pop.   
The organization takes cares of their players (Superstar or not) by resting them and not playing them on back to back games.   
The results was stupendous. The team manage to prolong the careers of most of their players. So in return, the players return the favor by staying with them for eternity and they don't ask for the moon and the stars when comes to salaries.

Kawhi Leonard is the Spurs new generation Superstar. The guy who will carry the torch from the hands old man Tim Duncan. The player who will give the team more championships. The person who will continue the San Antonio Spurs legacy. 

And it seems to look that way. Kawhi is more quiet than Duncan. Kawhi lives very simple even after signing a max deal. He often drives a rehabbed ’97 Chevy Tahoe, nicknamed Gas Guzzler, which he drove across Southern California’s Inland Empire as a teenager. “It runs,” Leonard explains, “and it’s paid off.”   
The basketball superstar with rocking cornrows, signed for 5 years with a whopping $94 million contract, is obessed with only getting coupons that guarantee him free chicken wings.   
That is how simple he is. Good sign for the Spurs for right... Their future looks bright!

Then comes the inevitable. In comes the Uncle. Ever since the Kawhi's uncle (his business manager) came in to picture, everything went south for the Spurs and Kawhi.   
There is a mysterious rift between the two parties. And it is not getting murkier as the days progresses. 

I really don't know the real story. But I have to think its the influence of the Uncle. There is this possibility that Kawhi might ask for a trade after the end of the season. And I won't be surprised if the organization succumb to his request. 

I like Kawhi! He is, by far, the best 2 way player in the league today.
