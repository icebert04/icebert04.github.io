Boracay, even with the environmental issues and sewage problem, still gathered 1.7 million tourists in  the duration of just a year. Koreans topped the foreign tourists who visited the famed island resort last year, accounting for 37% of the total number.

If you look at the world map, the Philippines is the nearest tropical country near South Korea. Koreans really dig the heat of the sun, especially on the beach, that is why they flock to our country all year round. 

Erron, 1st cousin of my wife, is one of resident living in Boracay island. He migrated in that pearly white sand island together with his wife and his son (also my inaanak).   
Erron immediately got a job as a tour guide and has never left the popular haven ever since.

But the one thing that made Erron special is his excellent service to his guests. He makes sure that all of his guests gets what they need. He sometimes goes home late at night because he needs to do overtime service to the request of his guests.   
Erron hardly complains and he treats his guests just like one of his close friends. 

He is so likable that if you look at his Facebook profile... you would see that he has lots of Korean friends. And mind you, the communication between the tour guide and his former foreign guests still went on and on.   
Koreans (and other nationalities) simply love him. Not only because of his wonderful service but Erron always smile to all people.
