Boracay, even with the environmental issues and sewage problem, still gathered 1.7 million tourists in  the duration of just a year. Koreans topped the foreign tourists who visited the famed island resort last year, accounting for 37% of the total number.

If you look at the world map, the Philippines is the nearest tropical country near South Korea. Koreans really dig the heat of the sun, especially on the beach, that is why they flock to our country year round.
