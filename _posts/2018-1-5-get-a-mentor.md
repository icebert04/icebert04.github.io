![Get A Mentor](/images/Get A Mentor.jpg)

The start of the New Year is the best time to begin a new life, a new approach, a new direction, and a new goal. And the best way to achieve that is to get a mentor.

Now it can be anyone or anybody. That person can be a Yoga instructor, or a somebody who is good in playing the Saxophone. Maybe take time to learn a new exiting recipe from a Executive Chef who is a classmate of your in high school, or take some Surfing lessons from a hunk down in Siargao.   
No matter what it is, find someone who is an expert and has experience and learn from that mentor.

Okay, what if you find that mentor but you hardly know that person. How will you approach? What is the best way to introduce yourself? My suggestion is this...   
Take that person out for lunch. Dinner would be nice too but a cup of coffee will also suffice. The important thing is you treat them out with consistency like every Wednesday until that person gets comfortable with you.   
It is like courting a girl. You need to put your best foot forward and give the "moon and stars" before getting anything. If that what is takes... then do it! Take action!
