![Get A Mentor](/images/Get A Mentor.jpg)

The start of the New Year is the best time to begin a new life, a new approach, a new direction, and a new goal. And the best way to achieve that is to get a mentor.

Now it can be anyone or anybody. That person can be a Yoga instructor, or a somebody who is good in playing the Saxophone. Maybe take time to learn a new exiting recipe from a Executive Chef who is a classmate of your in high school, or take some Surfing lessons from a hunk down in Siargao.   
No matter what it is, find someone who is an expert and has experience and learn from that mentor.

Okay, what if you find that mentor but you hardly know that person. How will you approach? What is the best way to introduce yourself? My suggestion is this...   
Take that person out for lunch. Dinner would be nice too but a cup of coffee will also suffice. The important thing is you treat them out with consistency like every Wednesday until that person gets comfortable with you.   
It is like courting a girl. You need to put your best foot forward and give the "moon and stars" before getting anything. If that what is takes... then do it! Take action!

I'm just lucky when I met mine. I never expected a mentor coming from a 78 year old guy. My mentor's name is "Andy", a retired Filipino-Chinese who used to be a entrepreneur from the automobile industry. He is now living with his children and rotating his stay/visit from one house to the other.

It was love at first sight in the beginning. In fact, I find him quite annoying from the first time I met him. Andy ask too many questions and gives so many advices (like I needed that).   
But overtime, I realized that his pesky questions are more of "Probing Questions". He did that because he wants to know me more.
