![Get A Mentor](/images/Get A Mentor.jpg)

The start of the New Year is the best time to begin a new life, a new approach, a new direction, and a new goal. And the best way to achieve that is to get a mentor.

Now it can be anyone or anybody. That person can be a Yoga instructor, or a somebody who is good in playing the Saxophone. Maybe take time to learn a new exiting recipe from a Executive Chef who is a classmate of your in high school, or take some Surfing lessons from a hunk down in Siargao.   
No matter what it is, find someone who is an expert and has experience and learn from that mentor.

Okay, what if you find that mentor but you hardly know that person. How will you approach? What is the best way to introduce yourself? My suggestion is this...   
Take that person out for lunch. Dinner would be nice too but a cup of coffee will also suffice. The important thing is you treat them out with consistency like every Wednesday until that person gets comfortable with you.   
It is like courting a girl. You need to put your best foot forward and give the "moon and stars" before getting anything. If that what is takes... then do it! Take action!

I'm just lucky when I met mine. I never expected a mentor coming from a 78 year old guy. My mentor's name is "Andy", a retired Filipino-Chinese who used to be a entrepreneur from the automobile industry. He is now living with his children and rotating his stay/visit from one house to the other.

It was love at first sight in the beginning. In fact, I find him quite annoying from the first time I met him. Andy ask too many questions and gives so many advices (like I needed that).   
But overtime, I realized that his pesky questions are more of "Probing Questions". He did that because he wants to know me more. He meticulously inspected my flaws, imperfections and bad habits.   
In other words, Andy wants to change me... for the better!

I met Andy last 2014 and since then I can say to myself that I'm a better, calmer and wiser person than before. There is a lot of positive things that I received from him but I will only name a few or  else this article will turn into a novel. 

Here are some of those...

1.) DEVELOP YOUR INNER CHI = Ch'i or Qi is a Chinese word of Life Energy. Each one of us has it but sadly, most of us doesn't know or not interested in utilizing it. Developing your Chi can be a way to heal your body – both physically and mentally – as well as a path to reaching your full potential.   
Do you know "The Force" in Star Wars?   
Believe me, that is true... from a certain point of view.

2.) BLOCK OUT ALL THE NEGATIVE = Although there is no escape from it, my mentor taught me how to minimize the negative and not get bothered by it. Andy taught me to read people's minds and why they act incorrectly. There is so much greed, envy, and hatred in this world that most people get infected by it. I sometimes wonder if the Yin and Yang (陰陽 yīnyáng, "positive-negative")is still balanced.   
But I have to believe that nature will allow the Yang (Positive) rise again into this world.

3.)
