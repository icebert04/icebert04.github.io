May tatlong bibe akong nakita
Mataba mapayat mga bibe
Ngunit ang may pakpak...

Well you know how the song goes. But to those who doesn't, it doesn't really matter. The important thing is the principle of a bibe. Bibe or Pato and even Itik are Tagalog term of Duck.  

Why Ducks! There are several reasons why a Filipino should raise ducks in their backyards, farms or vacant lands.  Consider the following:

Good source of protein.
Duck raising provides meat and eggs for the family.  Duck eggs are nutritious and provide needed protein for the family. Duck meat can be cooked in even more ways than chicken and is an excellent 
addition to the family diet.

More economical.
A farm family will have a daily supply of eggs, and you 
will be able to sell any surplus eggs for additional income.

More  practical.
Duck raising is more practical for a small backyard project than raising chickens.  Ducks are productive for a longer period of time than chickens.  You will need to replace your layers only once every 18 months in order to keep production high.   
This means saving on the cost of replacement stock.  Generally, you have to replace your laying flock only twice every three years.

Donâ€™t  require  elaborate  pens.
The birds do not require any elaborate housing with a multitude of windows, dropping-boards, perches,  and nest boxes. Generally, you can keep in ducks in simple sheds at night and let them loose during the day.

Rarely affected with diseases.
Ducks are very rarely afflicted with coccidiosis, and when this disease strikes, its effects are not  as bad as on chickens.  The ducks are also not as frequently affected by such fowl diseases as fowl pest and bacillary white diarrhea. 

Require little labor.
Ducks lay their eggs at night or early in the morning, so eggs can be collected in the morning before letting the ducks loose to range during the day.
