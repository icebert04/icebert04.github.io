![No Rice](/images/No Rice.jpg)

Today, I am no longer eating rice. I won't be eating any of it. As much as I love to eat rice that goes well with popular Filipino dishes like Sinigang, Kare-Kare, and Adobo... I just naturally need to look for alternative ways like oats, porridge, fruits and green vegetables.  

In the past few weeks, I've been exercising aggresively. But I know that exercise won't be enought so I need to cut on my food intake.   
So I tried to reduce my rice from Unlimited Rice to 1-2 cups. Then it went down to just cup of rice per meal. But somehow, I am still not content with the results.

In comes Mike. A neighnor of mine were we used to play Badminton and Basketball in our compound.
