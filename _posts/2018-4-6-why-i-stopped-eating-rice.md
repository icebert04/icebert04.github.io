![No Rice](/images/No Rice.jpg)

Today, I am no longer eating rice. I won't be eating any of it. As much as I love to eat rice that goes well with popular Filipino dishes like Sinigang, Kare-Kare, and Adobo... I just naturally need to look for alternative ways like oats, porridge, fruits and green vegetables.
