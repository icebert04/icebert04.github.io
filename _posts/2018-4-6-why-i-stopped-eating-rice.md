![No Rice](/images/No Rice.jpg)

Today, I am no longer eating rice. I won't be eating any of it. As much as I love to eat rice that goes well with popular Filipino dishes like Sinigang, Kare-Kare, and Adobo... I just naturally need to look for alternative ways like oats, porridge, fruits and green vegetables.  

In the past few weeks, I've been exercising aggresively. But I know that exercise won't be enough so I need to cut on my food intake.   
So I tried to reduce my rice from **Unlimited Rice** to 1-2 cups. Then it went down to just 1 cup of rice per meal. But somehow, I am still not content with the results.

In comes Mike. A neighnor of mine were we used to play Badminton and Basketball in our compound. Mike was able to slim his weight drastically just by taking coconuts as his regular diet. He just eats the meat of the fruit and the juice. He goes by just doing that regularly.   

So me and Mike talked and I asked a lot of question and what suggestion does he needs to give to me (the desperate one). Mike's advice is this.... 
"**Huwag kang kumain ng kanin**"! Or Don't eat rice! 

We all know that Filipinos eat rice everyday. It is the most widely consumed "Staple Food" for a large part in the Philippines. Its cheap and it goes well with any other Filipino dishes.   
But Rice is mainly composed of carbohydrates. Some types may cause unhealthy spikes in blood sugar, making them unsuitable for diabetics. I am not diabetic, but do I need to be one in order for me to stop eating the Filipinos most favorite staple food.
