![No Rice](/images/No Rice.jpg)

Today, I am no longer eating rice. I won't be eating any of it. As much as I love to eat rice that goes well with popular Filipino dishes like Sinigang, Kare-Kare, and Adobo... I just naturally need to look for alternative ways like oats, porridge, fruits & green vegetables.   
That's how it will go from now on.

In the past few weeks, I've been exercising aggressively. But I know that exercise won't be enough so I need to cut on my food intake.   
So I tried to reduce my rice from **Unlimited Rice** to 1-2 cups. Then it went down to just 1 cup of rice per meal. But somehow, I am still not content with the results.

In comes Mike. A neighbor of mine were we used to play Badminton & Basketball in our compound. Mike was able to reduce his weight drastically just by taking Coconuts as his regular diet. He just eats the meat of the fruit and the juice. He goes by just doing that regularly.   

So me and Mike talked and I asked a lot of questions and what suggestion does he needs to give to me (because I'm so desperate).   
Mike's advice to me is this.... 
"**Huwag kang kumain ng kanin**"! Or Don't eat rice! 

We all know that Filipinos eat rice everyday. It is the most widely consumed "**Staple Food**" for a large part in the Philippines. It's cheap and it goes well with any other Filipino dishes.   
But Rice is mainly composed of carbohydrates. Some types may cause unhealthy spikes in blood sugar, making them unsuitable for diabetics.   
I am not diabetic, but do I need to be one in order for me to stop eating Rice? 

A cup of the cooked white rice carries roughly 130 to 200 calories, most of which comes in the form of starch, which turns into sugar, and often thereafter body fat.   
Fat is like a Tattoo that stays with you forever.... unless of course you want to remove it (or minimize it at least).

Exercise and Diet is not really a hard thing to do. I choose my own Exercise habits according to my interest. And then I just replace my favorite dish to a more healthy (low calorie) food.   
Like replacing Taco Shells to Leafy Greens, French Fries to Turnips & Carrots, Lasagna to Zucchini, and Pancakes to Oatmeal Pancakes.   
The alternative are surprisingly more expensive than the original but who said that Health is cheap. Would you rather keep your money and get sick or vise versa? 

Its sad to know that most of us eat the wrong food. And what it makes more sad is we never choose to change it.   
It's never too late. We can still change. We don't need to take Giant steps to achieve that. Just one small step can make a BIG difference. Like skipping the midnight snack or cutting on the Soft-drinks. Inviting your friends & relatives for organic dinner rather than eating on a fast-food joint.   
Those small things really matter.

I've taken those small steps and today I added a few more by eliminating on Rice. I changed my mindset for reason that I want to live better and gain a richer healthy body.   
Better health is central to human happiness and well-being.

So **Goodbye Rice**! It's been nice knowing you! We had a good run but it's time to say "**Adieu**" in order for me to find my new Happiness!
