Fantasy to Reality

When I say about gaining new friends it doesn't mean that you just settle for less. Meaning you will just look for a stranger in the corner and have that unknown person be your new friend. Although that is the objective of the game, it also a welcome sight to aim for the Stars.

Just look for that somebody that you look up to like a Celebrity, a Sports Athlete, a Book Author, or even a Famous Painter. The choice is up to you.

The difficult part is getting their attention. The Big Challenge is how would a ordinary person (like you and me) even get to notice us. These famouse entities are too busy in their everyday lives. Do you think that they even have the slightest amount of time to ask you "Hi! How's your day going?"
You and I both know that our chance are slimmer the slim.

But I am up to the task. I don't care how hard and how long it will take. That is the purpose of Friendillion anyway. We don't just acquire the easy ones but we aspire to do the impossible.
I name this project as "Fantasy to Reality"!
