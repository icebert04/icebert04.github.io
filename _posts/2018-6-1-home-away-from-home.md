Do you ever get that feeling that when you take your long vacation then suddenly you miss home? That happens habitually when stay in your vacation spot for to long.   
You begin to miss stuff at home like your Wifi speed, the Malls and your favorite Restaurants, and the sense that you're being updated on all things.

Your vacation spot or Province of your selection, though blessed with natural resources and beautiful surroundings, probably doens't have the things that big cities like Manila have.   
So these Metropolitan people are most of the time forced to go back to Manila afraid of being left out  if they stay longer to Rural places.

Well, that's not the case in San Pablo, Laguna. It's a 1st class city in the south of Luzon. With a population of less than 300,000 locals, the places is popularly known as the "City of Seven Lakes"! San Pablo has a cool climate owing to its location. It is nestled in the foothills of three mountains: Mount Banahaw, Mount Makiling and the Sierra Madre Mountains. These mountains do not only provide attractions for the tourism industry (such as waterfalls) and sources of many forest-based products, but also serve as stewards for the clean air.

Whenever I have the chance, I drive for 2 hours to San Pablo, then rush to Laguna's beatified nature consists of lakes, waterfalls, and lagoons. Last time we were in San Pablo we went swimming in Pandin Lake, visited Nagcarlan's Underground Cementery, bought a few slippers in Liliw then took the heat off in Majajay's Falls.  

This year (exactly a week ago), we went back to San Pablo but decicided to stay put in house of my uncle and aunt (Tito and Tita), who happened to be a local in the city.   
My Tito Norman is a doctor and Tita Josie works basically at home. They have 2 daughters (1 working in Manila and 1 about to study in UPLB).   
They lived in a property roughly around 700 square meters (definitely bigger than Manila). 

In their home the lovely couple have 3 adult dogs, 6 puppies, 4 male cats, 1 senior citizen chicken, and 1 parakeet. Plus they got fruit bearing trees like Rambutan, Kamias, Calamansi, Sili and lots and lots of herbs.
