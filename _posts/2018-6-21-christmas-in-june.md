Santa Claus is coming to town. In fact, he's here with us in our home in the month of June. We are all so happy and blessed for his presence and the precious gifts that he brought all the way from North Pole.   
Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen and his most prized reindeer "Rudolph The Red Nose" were waiting patiently in our main street.   
My children even took pictures of Santa's sleight that weigh over 400,000 tons carrying all the toys for all the childreb all over the world.

So I asked Santa why did he paid us a visit in the midyear. Are we good to people so you decided to give your Christmas presents in advance?
Heck no! The gentleman said. I'm not Santa and I don't live in the North Pole. My name is Jim, a Canadian. Suddenly, the reindeers and the long sleigh dissapeared in our very eyes.   
It's all an illusion. So this guy must be an impostor.
