I have been to failed relationships in the past. Girls whom I tought would be the one who I would marry someday. I really the don't know the reason for my past breakups but I have to believe that is you should get "The Sign" in order to know if the person is it. 

Many of my hypothesis failed because of the wrong 1st impression first date. I tried proposing to a girl by giving a Yellow Lababrador as my proposal ring. Did it work? We had a good run but that's about it.   
How about bringing my date to overcrowded theme park in Santa Rosa? Did that work? Nah, we only relish on Echanted Kingdom night fireworks but it never push through on our relationships.   
My last failed one was a sporty one. Playing billiards one our first date will make people think that it's a pretty good idea but it ended up us two fooling and playing around with each other.   
Neither one of those dates that I had went the extra mile. 

For me, I need to get "The Sign" and I should get a very good 1st impression on that first date to make it work.   
I was starting to be afraid that I will have nobody in my life. Some guys like that, to have the "Flavors of Month" availble whenever they need it. But not me. I want to setlle down, get married to the love of my life and live happy forever after.... just like in Walt Disney Movies!
