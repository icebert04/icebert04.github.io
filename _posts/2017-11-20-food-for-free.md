Avocado and scrambled eggs for breakfast anyone? I guess everybody would want that kind of meal (especially if you are health conscious).   
I saw this picture from a post of my friend in New York (A well renowned fitness & wellness coach) and I was thinking that if he can have that kind of meal there, then we can it here too as well.

Sure, we can buy nutritious food like Avocado and Eggs in the grocery and wet market. But wouldn't it better if we can have those food for FREE. 

How? There are lots of ways exactly..

1.) You can plant different kinds of fruits and vegetables in your own backyard. With the help of good ole' **GOOGLE**, you can search and get ideas of specific food that you want to have on your table.   
There are also a lot of available Free seminars and Facebook Groups that you can join and get generous information about organic urban farming.   
If your village assocation will give consent, you have the option to take in a few egg laying chickens that will lay organic eggs for you and your family all year round.


2.) I'm sure each one of us has a province. Some are near Manila and some quite far. But the truth of the matter is, you don't really need to be there most of the time. Your relatives like your Tito, Pinsan, Pamangkin, etc. can take care of your Livestock Farm Animals like...

- Pigs (Bacon, Sisig, Crispy Pata, Ham, Pork Chops, Liempo and even Lechon)
- Cow and Goats (Milk, Cheese, Yoghurt, Steak, Kaldareta, Pinapaitan, Lengua and Burger Patties) 
- Chickens and Ducks (Eggs, Salted Eggs, Balut, Chicken Pies, and Roasted Duck)

- For you Fruits and Vegatables you can have...
- Asparagus, Cherry Tomatoes, Carrot Cakes, Strawberry Icecream, 
- Calamansi Juice, Mashed Potatoes and French Fries, Mushroom Risotto,
- All the Fruit and Vegetables Smoothies that you want...

Just make sure that you have a trustworthy relative or someone that will take charge of your mini-farm. The important thing is that you can get a bountiful harvest of food every month.

3.) What if you don't have a backyard, province and idle lands?   
No problem... all you have to do is follow the concept of Friendillion and get new friends or acquitances in the province that is near to your home. Province near the city like Cavite, Laguna and Batangas in the south and Bulacan and Pampamga in the North.   
I suggest that you start your mini farm very small since you barely knew the person who will manage your crops and animals.   
For instance, you want Calamansi drink. Go, learn and exctract all the information about Calamansi like knowing different varieties, diseases, and even soil propagation.   
It wouldn't hurt if the person that is handling your mini farm is knowledgeable in Calamansi farming.    
It's totally up to you if you want your mini farm just for your daily consumption or if you want to upgrade and go full scale to commercial farming and earn a profit.


All of us are spending 40%-50% on Food. That doesn't even include when you dine out.   
My intention here is not to decrease our grocery and food expenses but to ADD more nutritious and valuable food from sources outside of the city that you don't really need to buy.   
Remember that the food that we buy in the groceries and supermarkets are 3 times higher compared when you buy it from the source.   
Eggs in the groceries cost Php 9 per piece while you can a have a dozen or more if you have a few hens in an open yard.

I too do buy from the grocery because it is convenient, but do I really know how good are the food items there? Are they organic? How fresh are they?   
Plus you only get a few compared when buying from the province where you get an ample. 

So starting today, I will be starting my Free Food program in my province in Balayan Batangas.   
It will be my diary and I will share it to all of you all the things that I've accomplished and achieved so far.   
Life is so precious.... and eating the right food will add more years to your life. You get to help poor people to earn a living, and you get to experience provincial life and escape the very busy & hustle city life. 

Everyone loves Avocado and Eggs for breakfast... most especially when it is FREE!
