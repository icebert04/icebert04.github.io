Avocado and scrambled eggs for breakfast anyone? I guess everybody would want that kind of meal (especially if you are health buff).   
I saw this picture from a post of my friend in New York and I was thinking that if he can have that kind of meal we can it here too as well.

Sure, we can buy nutritious food like Avocado and Eggs in the grocery and wet market. But wouldn't it better if we can have those food for FREE. 

How? There are lots of ways exactly..

1. You can plant different kinds of fruits and vegetables in your own backyard. With the help of good ole' Google you can search and get ideas of specific food that you want to have on your table.   
There are also a lot of available seminars and Facebook Groups that you can joined and get substantial information of organic urban farming.   
If your village assocation will also allow you can several egg laying chickens that will lay organic eggs for you and your family all year round.

2. I'm sure each one of us has a province. Some are near Manila and some a quite far. But the truth of the matter is you don't really need to be there most of the time. Your relatives like your Tito, Pinsan, Pamangkin, etc. can take of your fruits and vegetables and your livestock farm animals like Pigs for Bacon, Cow and Goats for your Milk and Chickens for your Eggs.   
Just make sure that you have a trustworthy relative or someone that will take care of your mini-farm. The important thing is that you can get bountiful different kinds of food every month.

3. What if you don't have a backyard, province and idle lands? No problem... all you have to do is follow the concept of Friendillion and get new friends or acquitances on the province that is near to your home. Province near the city like Cavite, Laguna and Batangas in the south and Bulacan and Pampamga in the North.   
I suggest that you start your mini farm small since you barely knew the person who will manage your stocks. For instance, you want Calamansi drink. Go, learn and exctract all the information about Calamansi from varieties, diseases, and even soil propagation.   
It wouldn't hurt if the person that is handling your mini farm is knowledgeable in Calamansi farming.    
It's totally up to you in you want your mini farm just for your daily consumption or if you want to upgrade and go full scale to commercial farming and profits.
