![The Germans](/images/Raya Garden 27.jpg)

Germany has gotten a bad reputation due to the dictator Adolf Hitler. But not all Germans are bad. In fact, Hitler came from Austria, same as his parents.   
I had to meet 2 young Germans who were here with us for a few weeks. I'll tell you, they are the nicest and warmest people. They are so easy to get along with. I made it a point to take some time off from my work and just bond with them. It turns out to be a good decision. My kids also like them that included Germany on their "Visit List" if we are fortunate to travel to Europe.
