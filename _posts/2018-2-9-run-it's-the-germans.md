![The Germans](/images/Raya Garden 27.jpg)

Germany has gotten a bad reputation due to the dictator Adolf Hitler. But not all Germans are bad. In fact, Hitler came from Austria, same as his parents.   
I had to meet 2 young Germans who were here with us for a few weeks. I'll tell you, they are the nicest and warmest people. They are so easy to get along with. I made it a point to take some time off from my work and just bond with them. It turns out to be a good decision. My kids also like them that included Germany on their "Visit List" if we are fortunate to travel to Europe.

We came to know a lot of things about them. The reason why they travel, their school back home, their govenrment and the refugees, their culture, and many more.
We may have different background stories based from our distinct nationalities but for me... they are just like Regular Joes... like any other Filipino. In other words, they are also human beings.... duh!!!

Come to think of it, Germany is not a bad country at all. Currently, both domestic and international undergraduates at public universities in Germany can study for FREE!   
They have 9 different borders (France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland - phew), that you can travel to by just taking a bus or train.   
They have the Beers, the Sauerkraut & sausages, the Beethoven, Mozart, Bach and Brahms. Plus, Germany is also home to some of Europeâ€™s finest and most famous castles.   

Aside from the dogs (German Sheperd, Doberman, Rottweiler, and Dachsund), they also have the best automobiles such as BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche and Volkswagen.
