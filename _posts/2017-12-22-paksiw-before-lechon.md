![Paksiw Before Lechon](/images/Paksiw.jpg)

I do it the other way around... I eat the Paksiw first then comes the Lechon! How do I do that exactly???   
My Answer: **I got friends from La Loma**... La Loma is located on the southwest area of Quezon City and before Cebu gained popularity for its Lechon, La Loma in Quezon City has been dubbed as the Lechon Capital of the Philippines for many years.
