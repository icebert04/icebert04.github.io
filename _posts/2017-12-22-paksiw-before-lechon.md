![Paksiw Before Lechon](/images/Paksiw.jpg)

I do it the other way around... I eat the Paksiw first then comes the Lechon! How do I do that exactly???   
My Answer: **"I got Friends from La Loma"**...   

La Loma is located on the southwest area of Quezon City and before Cebu gained popularity for its Lechon, La Loma has been dubbed as the Lechon Capital of the Philippines for many years.   
For those who doesn't know what a Paksiw looks like... Lechon Paksiw (or Paksiw) is made from leftover Lechon (whole roasted pig) cooked in a homemade Lechon sauce, vinegar, and simple spices.

Normally, most people buy the Lechon first then they cooked the leftover and make it into a Paksiw.   My story is different... My Friends from La Loma sends me the Paksiw first then after the Lechon.   
I remember the time when I went to their place in La Loma. Their Lechon store is at the corner of the main street which is pretty much a good and stratetic location in capturing new customers. And while I was talking to the owner, I carefully observe how the Lechon (of different sizes) were line up in front of their store.   
The motorists will then park their cars and order their preferred Lechon sizes. I was startled to see them all gone before the end of the day. 

Sometimes when they have Lechon that are left at the end of the day (which is very rare) they make the leftovers as Paksiw and sell it to their customers. But even the Paksiw are like Meteorites from outer space that comes once in a blue moon.   
I myself can testify to that. Their Paksiw is probably the best Paksiw that I've tried so far. The owner and her loyal sister whom everybody calls **"Mamita"** made this Paksiw with special ingredients. According to them, they cooked it diffirently that is why it is so rich and tasty. The sauce in their Paksiw is well blended with the meat and the skin is so soft and tender.

I am so fortunate that I am just one of the few to get gift(s) from them every year before Christmas. When I receive this Paksiw, I skip all my regular meals until the Paksiw runs out. So I have Paksiw at breakfast, lunch, dinner and even at Midnight snack. And on the following day, I repeat the routine.   
I don't mind eating (Paksiw & Lechon) more than the usual during Yuletide Season. I just make it a point to burn all those fats that I've gained first thing at the start of the New Year. 

How did I met these kind people? Simple, just by being the Driver, Nanny and Bodyguard of my eldest son Aikido lessons every Saturday. I got to know almost every one of them from the owner all the way to the Yaya.   
And today, I am one of the Godfather (Ninong) to the owner's youngest grandchild named Andy.   
It's a funny story I know but I am surely glad to meet them (not just the Lechon).

So my advice to all of you... Go out and meet new people. Don't be shy or think negative about them. They are just people like you and me. Don't let them be the first them to greet you. Make it a habit to reach out to them firsts. Smiling and saying Hi is the typical icebreakers. Then the ball will start rolling after and soon you will have your new friend. 

Like my story, I just smiled and said Hi... the next thing I know is got Paksiw in my hand!
