![Paksiw Before Lechon](/images/Paksiw.jpg)

I do it the other way around... I eat the Paksiw first then comes the Lechon! How do I do that exactly???   
My Answer: **I got friends from La Loma**... La Loma is located on the southwest area of Quezon City and before Cebu gained popularity for its Lechon, La Loma has been dubbed as the Lechon Capital of the Philippines for many years.   
For those who doesn't know what a Paksiw looks like... Lechon Paksiw (or Paksiw) is made from leftover Lechon (whole roasted pig) cooked in a homemade Lechon sauce, vinegar, and simple spices.
