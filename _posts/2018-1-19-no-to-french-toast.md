A lof of guys thinks that girls are a "Piece of Snack"! To them Girls are like Food that they want to eat whenever they are hungry. And they don't care regardless of their marital status. Whether they are  single, divorced, widowed and even worse.... married.   
Girls are not Sex Toys or Snack that you can play with. They are human beings with feelings and dreams like you and me.

A year ago, I met a pretty girl from France. Let's just call her Michelle (not her real name). I choose not to declare her real name so that guys won't be bugging her and asking her social media accounts.   
She went here in the Philippines to explore the wonderful beaches and the sublime nature that goes along with it.
Michelle is now in Chile continuing her studies but said that she wants to go back to the Philippines to travel to the other islands she hasn't been to and hopefully start a small business venture a long the way.


Meet my friend from France. I met her a year ago and we've been close ever since. She likes to travel to different countries and said she dooesn't want to go back to her motherland. She also said the me that she loves the Philippines and is planning to go back this year to travel again and do some business
