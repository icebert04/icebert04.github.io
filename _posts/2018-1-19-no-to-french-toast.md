A lof of guys thinks that girls are a "Piece of Snack"! To them Girls are like Food that they want to eat whenever they are hungry. And they don't care regardless of their marital status. Whether they are  single, divorced, widowed and even worse.... married.   
Girls are not Sex Toys or Snack that you can play with. They are human beings with feelings and dreams like you and me.

A year ago, I met a pretty girl from France. Let's just call her Michelle (not her real name). I choose not to declare her real name so that guys won't be bugging her and asking her social media accounts.   
She went here in the Philippines to explore the wonderful beaches and the sublime nature that goes along with it.
Michelle is now in Chile continuing her studies but said that she wants to go back to the Philippines to travel to the other islands she hasn't been to and hopefully start a small business venture a long the way.

Me and Michelle became close and always talk through our social media channels. She showed me her passion for traveling. She has been to most of European countries. She told me her stories in riding the crazt train in Sri Lanka, Teaching the young kids in Senegal, Playing with the penguins in Cape Town, Do outreach project in Indonesia, Surfing in the Philippines, Driving a boat in the coast of Australia, and much much more. And mind you.... she is only 24 years old and is still a student. 

She is a interesting girl! So much passion, so much vitality and eagerness to know more of things outside of her comfort zone, and I see so much adventures in her.    

The crasy thing is... some of my Filipino "So called friends" were teasing me that I should be targeting her as a Snack. They want me to try a different International cuisine like a Croissant or 
the Soupe à l’oignon. I answered back and said "Sorry boys, but there is no way you can get me out of  my favorite Adobo"!
