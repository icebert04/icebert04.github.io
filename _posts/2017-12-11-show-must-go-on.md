![My Darling Sister](/images/Roberta.jpg)

My youngest sister passed away last December 1, 2017 (Same day as my Birthday). Since then, I don't want to get up from the bed. Would rather lock myself in the bedroom to cry and contemplate on why she departed so early (26 years of age).   
She had so many things to do and accomplish. She has so many talents to share and expose to the world. People were just getting to know her.... Why?

I always ask the question even up today. Why don't they get the souls of the bums, the murderers, and all the pest in our society. Why her?

Then I reflected upon and accepted that it is her time. Our creator said to her "You've done enough... Let them continue!"
