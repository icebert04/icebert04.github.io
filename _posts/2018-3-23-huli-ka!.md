Have you ever tried driving in the city of Makati? How was it? How many times did you get lost in the city? How many times did you get caught by the traffic enforcers?   
If you didn't had problem in Makati then either you are damn lucky or you don't go often to the busy place.

For the record, I witness my car being towed for illegal parking (even when there is no sign near the premises), caught for making a left turn (again no sign on site), and illegally entering a No Entry road without being caught.
