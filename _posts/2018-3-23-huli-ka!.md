Have you ever tried driving in the city of Makati? How was it? How many times did you get lost in the city? How many times did you get caught by the traffic enforcers?   
If you didn't had problem in Makati then either you are damn lucky or you don't go often to the busy place.

For the record, I witness my car being towed for illegal parking (even when there is no sign near the premises), caught for making a left turn (again no sign on site), and illegally entering a No Entry road without being caught.

I know that Makati City stands out as the **Economic Heart** of the Philippines. Still has the highest concentration of multinational and local corporations in the country today. And it serves as one of several key financial, professional and commercial centers within all the Asian countries. 
But... can they do someting with the **Traffic Rules**!!! 

Although its population is just half a million, the daytime population of the city is estimated to be more than one million during a typical working day because of the large number of people who go to the city to work, shop, and do business. Traffic is expected mostly during rush hour and holiday seasons.
