![Running Companion](/images/Jack Russell 9.jpg)

When I exercise, I always do Swimming. I also intend to do Biking but never Running. Maybe it's just me but I find it boring. But if I get a running companion. Someone who will force to jog regulary...

Introducing the Jack Russell Terrier! Developed in England some 200 years ago to hunt foxes, the Jack Russell Terrier (Jacks or JRT for short) are the biggest dogs you'll ever meet in such tiny package. They can run all day and keep coming back for more. He has tons of energy and won't be satisfied by a sedate walk around the block. This breed strictly needs 30 to 45 minutes of daily vigorous exercise.

So the Jack Russell Terrier is going to be "The Answer" for my jogging dilemma. The dog will force me to go outdoors to walk him (or run with him). The JRT will be my alarm clock in the morning to take my  morning run.

And since this breed doesn't run out of batteries, my kids and maybe my wife will need to take our dog out in the evening as well. So the Jack Russell terrier will keep me and my family healthy since we need to take him/her out for a walk/run.

Before, I was thinking of getting other popular breeds like the Pug or the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. Though this breeds are cute and nice to be with, they won't be helping me and my family exercise like the Jack Russell terrier.

And as proof of this breed's purpose, even our famous Philippine boxer Manny Pacquiao has a JRt who was running with our champ since 2006. The dog (whom they call Pacman)is no stranger to his master’s morning road runs up tough trails. In fact, he’s one of the few who could even keep up with boxing’s only eight-division champion’s from start to finish, and that’s no easy feat.   
Just ask some of Manny Pacquiao’s jogging buddies in Los Angeles who couldn’t even keep pace with the Filipino boxer.
