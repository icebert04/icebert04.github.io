My 10 year old niece Sofia is very shy and quiet girl. She normally just says hello to people whenever there is a gathering. Then she looks for a place to sit and play her iPad. She never talk to much....  Little did I know that she is an "**Aspiring YouTuber**"!

A YouTuber are personalities and videographers who have gained popularity from their videos. A lot of Filipinos made big money out of YouTube.   
Guys like Wil Dasovich, an award-winning Filipino American YouTuber known for his daily vlogs.   
Will already gained more than 1 Million subscribers and approximately earns $2,000/PHP 100,000 monthly. 

Another one is Ranz Kyle and his very talented sister Niana, who could be the next "**Dance Princess**". Their channel is all about moves and grooves on the new dance craze.   
With their almost close to 4 Million stronghold subscribers, their estimated earnings are over $5,000/PHP 290,000 a month just from their YouTube channel.

It's crazy! It's really hard to believe... but all of this are TRUE!

So upon checking my niece YouTube channel. I took a minute to pause and think and then gave my "**Unsolicited Advice**".   
One thing I notice is her YouTube channel only has 8 subscribers. After I subscribed her channel, I laid out my ideas and suggestions to her.

1.) **EXPOSURE** =  I told her that she needs to expose her YouTube channel to every social media and all throughout the cyber world. Start first with her friends, families and relatives. 

2.) **NICHE**  =  I showed Sofia my past project called "**MyLungga.com**". It's a site that sells properties in the Philippines. The objective is I take videos of houses (like MTV Cribs), upload it in YouTube, then expect a hoards of buyers to call you after.   
I believe I was one of the first who did this but now you will see a lot of YouTubers who are doing the same thing that I did.   
So again, you need to have a niche. You need to be unique, different and have a specialty on one thing.

3.) **CONSISTENCY**  =  My last advice is I think the most important part.... Constancy and Regularity. This where it separates the Men from the Boys or in her case the **Women from the Girls**. A lot of talented people were hot and famous before but unheard-of after beacuse of this.   
You need to keep up with your stories... rain or shine, good times or bad times, in sickness and in health till death you part.


Regardless, I am very proud of my niece. Not just because she is my blood but she has the **Prowess and the Venturesomeness** knowing and hoping that her YouTube channel will make a good personality of her in the future.... 1 million subscribers or none.
