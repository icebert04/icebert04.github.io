My 10 year old niece is very shy and quiet. Sofia just says hello to people whenever there is a gathering. She just sits in one chair and play her iPad.   
Little did I know that she is an "**Aspiring YouTuber**"!

A YouTuber are personalities and videographers who have gained popularity from their videos. A lot of Filipinos made big money out of YouTube. Guys like Wil Dasovich, an award-winning Filipino American YouTuber known for his daily vlogs. Will already gained more than 1 Million subscribers and approximately earns $2,000/PHP 100,000 monthly. 

Another one is Ranz Kyle and his very talented sister Niana, who could be the next "**Dance Princess**".
