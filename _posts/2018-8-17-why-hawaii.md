3 days ago, I popped a question in Social Media (particularly on Facebook) about what is the ideal place for a family to live in. I was blown away by the results that a lot of advice, comments and private messages poured in.   
I got a sincere invitation from locals living in Mindanao, Visayas, and Luzon. As well as some proposition from friends and relatives in foreign countries like Canada, Australia, and The United States. 
Those people who have replied and responded was more than what I needed.   
To be honest, I was overwhelmed with their heartfelt solicitation. Every place that they mentioned were all enticing to me and my family. 

And then, out of the blue, I've heard a whisper from far far away.... 5,307 miles to be exact.  I heard a voice from the massive ocean of the North Pacific. That voice is my cousin Lynn for the islands of Hawaii.   
Lynn said... **"Come to Hawaii Francis"**! "It's family friendly as opposed to the other 49 states". "There are lot's of fun activities for the young and old". **"You will definitely like it here"**!

I'd video called her the following day and asked for more details of the island that she is staying in. She even sent me links of the immigration process, entry requirements, etc.  
Lynn's voice was so tempting that it made me re-think my plans all over again.   
I've now added Hawaii on our list. 

Why Hawaii? The island's **"Remoteness"** (2,500 miles to the next closest landmass) is the perfect destination for anyone who wants some private time. The nightscapes, star-gazing, and moonrises are very common in the island.   
Hawaii's diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, an abundance of public beaches, oceanic surroundings, and active volcanoes make it a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists.
They have the most unique culture and is popularly known for the **"Ukulele"**, **"Surfing"**, **"Aloha"**, **"Pau Hana"**, **"SPAM Jam"**, **"Pineapples"**, and the **"Shaka"**.

Hawaii for me is like the "Bridge of Cultures" of The Philippines and the USA.   
Hawaii has the best beaches just like in our country and at the same time is part of the 50 states in the USA. Which means that Hawaii is backed up by America's technology and infrastructure. 
It's perfect!

Lynn added that her 2 daughters are also homeschooled but they rushed to the waves to surf immediately after. They are out on the beach almost every day. They have so many outdoor activities are very deadly in hand to hand combat (Gracie Jiu-Jitsu). Most of their pictures that are posted on social media are all smiles. I've never seen a sign of frown on their face (a proof of genuine happiness). 
The adults too are having the time of their lives. Lynn and her husband work so hard but still, they are the "Happiest Citizen in America".   
Hawaii locals are less stressed and happier than residents of any other state â€” they also live longer. 

Me and my family are moving on to another chapter in our lives. We are a family with a bigger and brighter vision. 
Nothing is set in stone yet and we don't have any definitive place to move on to. But we are certainly looking...

The waves from the Pacific ocean brought Lynn and family to the beautiful island of Hawaii. 
I just have to let nature take its course and see if that same waves will bring me and my family to that prestigious haven. 
I wonder if I should start now and be familiarized by saying the word... ALOHA!
