![Real Mother](/images/Mary Grace Rillo.jpg)

Tomorrow is Mother's Day! While we are all accustomed to give importance to our mothers, wifes, and even daughters... to me, there is a different type of mother that lingers in our society.   
Her name is Sr. Mary Grace Rillo, Superior of the Carmelites in the province of Lipa City, Batangas. Although she is fully devoted in the house of God, she makes time to check on the well being on each and every member of her family (even to the farthest degree). 

Sr. Mary Grace is a Scholastican and the eldest amongst her siblings. She should be taking care of the properties, businesses of her family but instead is living the call to contemplative life in a powerhouse of prayer.   
I grew up knowing that I have an aunt who is a nun at one of the church in Batangas. I remember that my Grandmother (Tita Caring) and my Mom used to visit Sr. Mary Grace church regularly.   
As a child, I always get bored going to that place. There's not much to do there but **"Sit and Pray"**.   
But I always been hearing stories about that nun who help a lot of people. This began to question me... Why is she so special to a lot of people? What made her different from the others?

Years past and both my Lola and my Mom gone to meet our creator. Now, it is just me who visit Sr. Mary Grace. Not that often but still managed to stop by especially when I'm around the area.   
We talked a lot. Not only on the vicinity where is stationed but through social media (Yes, they are allowed to us Facebook).
