![Real Mother](/images/Mary Grace Rillo.jpg)

Tomorrow is Mother's Day! While we are all accustomed to give importance to our mothers, wifes, and even daughters... to me, there is a different type of mother that lingers in our society.   
Her name is Sr. Mary Grace Rillo, Superior of the Carmelites in the province of Lipa City, Batangas. Although she is fully devoted in the house of God, she makes time to check on the well being on each and every member of her family (even to the farthest degree). 

Sr. Mary Grace is a Scholastican and the eldest among her siblings. She should be taking care of the properties, businesses of her family but instead is living the call to contemplative life in a powerhouse of prayer.
