![Fiesta](/images/Parada ng Lechon 5.jpg)

Although geographically small, the Philippines has probably the most number of fiesta (more than 42,000 festivals) and deriving to a point that this country could be one of the happiest country in the world.   
Theoretically, a foreign tourist can visit the Philippines spending only their airline and accommodation and not worry about food expenses if they are going to attend all the Fiestas in the country.

It's funny to think that with all the problems that the country faces today these fiestas somewhat decreases it. A fact that the Philippines absorbs 20 storms per year that destroys hundreds of houses of the poor Filipinos but still manage to smile at camera of the media is sign that Filipinos are Jolly People regardless of the circumstances.
