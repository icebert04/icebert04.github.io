My weekends are compose of morning swims and Internet only. And when I go to my Facebook, I see some of my friends riding their big bike to a far away place.   
And then I go like... hhhmmm, I wish I could do that. But that weekend passed and another one went by and still I see them riding their bikes.   
This time, I was thinking... maybe I should get one.

At first I thought that these friends of mine like (Carlos, Raymond, Raul, And Tito) are just out to "Show-Off" their new motorcycle. And when I do check out the prices of these precious bikes I go nuts and back off immediately.
There's no way I will buy those damn motorcycles. They are way to expensive and I could use the money for much important things.

But lately, I start to realize, that these friends of mine are not showing off their bikes to make us feel envious. They are teaching each one of us (especially the boys) what we are missing out. That life has so much to offer aside from the normal weekend routine.

I also learned that the price of the bike is not "**Acquiring the Vehicle but Gaining New Adventures**".
