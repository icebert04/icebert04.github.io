My weekends are compose of morning swims and Internet only. And when I go to my Facebook, I see some of my friends riding their big bike to a far away place.   
And then I go like... hhhmmm, I wish I could do that. But that weekend passed and another one went by and still I see them riding their bikes.   
This time, I was thinking... maybe I should get one.

At first I thought that these friends of mine like (Carlos, Raymond, Raul, And Tito) are just out to "Show-Off" their new motorcycle. And when I do check out the prices of these precious bikes I go nuts and back off immediately.
There's no way I will buy those damn motorcycles. They are way to expensive and I could use the money for much important things.

But lately, I start to realize, that these friends of mine are not showing off their bikes to make us feel envious. They are teaching each one of us (especially the boys) what we are missing out. That life has so much to offer aside from the normal weekend routine.

I also learned that the price of the bike is not "**Acquiring the Vehicle but Gaining New Adventures**". Adventures that you can only experince through riding the motorcycle. 

The thrill of being at one with a two-wheeled machine that weighs only a few hundred pounds is one of the purest ways to get from point A to B. 

If you don't have a New Year's resolution yet, I suggest that you make this year in which you finally get a motorcycle. Here are some of the reasons why you should get one...

1.) **You'll Find Your Zen** = We live in a jittery world; there are so many demands for our attention. If you are a person in a relationship with kids, a family, a job and ambitions, it may at times feel that everything you do is at the service of someone or something else; that every action you take is directed by something external.

On a motorcycle, it's just your little head inside that helmet. You are in control of you, totally and completely. You feel the immediacy of your actions and decisions. The zen state pushes away anxiety about deadlines and bills to pay, and whether that girl at Starbucks was flirting when she told you to have a nice day.

2.) **You Meet the Nicest People** = You'll be greeted by waves or nods or extended feet when you pass other riders. Motorcycling induces a small town friendliness among its participants, no matter where they are in the world. Showing up somewhere on a bike means people will go out of their way to talk to you, to share stories.
