My weekends are compose of morning swims and Internet only. And when I go to my Facebook, I see some of my friends riding their big bike to a far away place.   
And then I go like... hhhmmm, I wish I could do that. But that weekend passed and another one went by and still I see them riding their bikes.   
This time, I was thinking... maybe I should get one.

At first I thought that these friends of mine like (Carlos, Raymond, Raul, And Tito) are just out to "Show-Off" their new motorcycle. And when I do check out the prices of these precious bikes I go nuts and back off immediately.
There's no way I will buy those damn motorcycles.
