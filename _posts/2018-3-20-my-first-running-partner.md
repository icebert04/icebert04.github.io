In my past article, I mentioned that I want to get a dog as my running partner. Although it looks like a fine idea, the problem is I don't have the space in my place to keep a running dog.   
There's this option to get a Jack Russell Terrier that suits in condominium living but I'm not sure if I am ready for that yet.

So instead of getting a dog what not just borrow a dog. You have to agree that it is a better idea. You get to run the dog that you don't own plus you don't have to feed and take care of that do since it is not your dog.   
And I'm pretty sure that the owner of that dog would be happy to have their dog get some outdoor exercise with me.

So I went to my cousin Nico. I knew back then that he has a black Labrador Retriever. That dog is built for hunting and retrieving wild ducks. Perfect as my running partner. What could go wrong?

To my surprise, the Labrador Retriever is not the pup that I used to know before. He grew and grew big mightily. He is stocky and got the jaws and head bone structure of a fierce dog... just like a Rottwelier and a Pitbull.
