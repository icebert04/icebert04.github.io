What is my Purpose in Life? 

We all do have an aspiration or goal in life. From drinking milk from your mother's mammary glands until you reach the rocking chair age. We may have different routes and plans but is all pretty much the same...

Play when you're a kid, Go to School, Play some more, Get a Job (Business), Be in Love, Get Married, Have Kids, Make your Kids finish School, Retire and Play with your Grandchildren, Then go Back to your Creator.

Some may never get married or have kids, Some prefer to Travel, Some are Workaholic, and some thinks they are still a Kid that never gets old. But our common purpose are all the same.

I too have that same purpose.
