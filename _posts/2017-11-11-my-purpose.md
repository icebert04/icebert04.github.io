What is my Purpose in Life? 

We all do have an aspiration or goal in life. From drinking milk from your mother's mammary glands until you reach the rocking chair age. We may have different routes and plans but is all pretty much the same...

Play when you're a kid, Go to School, Play some more, Get a Job (Business), Be in Love, Get Married, Have Kids, Make your Kids finish School, Retire and Play with your Grandchildren, Then go Back to your Creator.
Some may never get married or have kids, Some prefer to Travel, Some are Workaholic, and some thinks they are still a Kid that never gets Old. But our common purpose are all the same.

I too have that same purpose. I enjoyed my Youth, Got good Education, Had several good and bad Businesses (Jobs too), Married the Love of my Life, Rewarded with 2 Handsome Boys, Travelled to different places, and Help People along the way.
And when the time comes when I go back to my creator, I can say that I did my Purpose in Life. Or not... 

Did I really did my Purpose? I feel that there is something more.. Each one of us has a gift. God gave me a gift being good in Personal Relationships. Some say it's a little bit intrusive but for me it is my way of helping and enlighting people with problems and insecurities to live a Happy Life. 
I may not be Perfect and still lack a lot of things but I am more than contented in life.

That is why I created Friendillion... To gain more friends, To meet interesting inviduals and Learn from them, To maintain my Old friends, To add more adventures, and add more Spice in my life.
Hopefully, this project will influence other people to live a Better Life by not closing their doors but rather open their gates of more friends
