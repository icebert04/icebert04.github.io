![Fly Me To The Moon](/images/Junie 4.jpg)

I got a call from my friend Junie a few weeks ago. He and I go way way back. So after a few minutes of   chit chat, Junie made his pitch and asked this...

"Franz, ano bang magandang business"?

And this is what I replied to him...

"Are you kidding me? you are way more talented than me"! 

In fact, Junie is truly is such a talented person and I should be asking advice from him and not the other way around.   
For starters, he is an excellent musician and lead guitairist. He even created a Rock band called "Mahabaratbu" during the Club Dredd days.   
Aside from that, he teaches me and my friends in our village in Pasig to play the guitar correctly and with passion.

Junie opened our eyes and exposed us to the Real Music and not the boring romantic Barry Manilow for the couples. He introduce us to well renowned Rock Bands like Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Rage Against The Machine, Pantera, Sepultura and many more.   
It totally liberated us and made us "Real Men"! Such an awakening indeed!

On a lighter note, Junie is also good in composing love letters. He used to make love letters for me for the girl that I was courting in University of Asia and the Pacific. He is such good in words that he can work for Hallmark Cards. Or he can contribute articles for the the Newsweek, Reader's Digest, 
Rolling Stone, or the National Geographic.

Everything really went well for Junie like he is flying to the moon. He could touch the skies whenever he aims for his dreams.

But like all of us, Junie made mistakes and failed in life. This made he fall down on earth hard and very painful. Those unfortunate events clouded his thinking and decision making.   
Although he tried on climbing back, he keeps on going back to the dirty ground. What made it worse, some of friends of his kept saying to him that he is no good and should do things that other commong people do.   
He may reach the distance sometimes but he never really made it as far as the moon. To my knowledge that really hurt him.
