I got a call from my friend Junie a few weeks ago. He and I go way way back. So after a few minutes of   chit chat, Junie made his pitch and asked this...

"Franz, ano bang magandang business"?

And this is what I replied to him...

"Are you kidding me? you are way more talented than me"! 

In fact, Junie is truly is such a talented person and I should be asking advice from him and not the other way around.   
For starters, he is an excellent musician and lead guitairist. He even created a Rock band called "Mahabaratbu" during the Club Dredd days.   
Aside from that, he teaches me and my friends in our village in Pasig to play the guitar correctly and with passion.

Junie opened our eyes and exposed us to the Real Music and not the boring romantic Barry Manilow for the couples. He introduce us to well renowned Rock Bands like Nirvana, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Metallica, Rage Against The Machine, Pantera, Sepultura and many more.   
It totally liberated us and made us "Real Men"! Such an awakening indeed!
