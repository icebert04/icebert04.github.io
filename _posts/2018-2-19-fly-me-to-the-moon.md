![Fly Me To The Moon](/images/Junie 4.jpg)

I got a call from my friend Junie a few weeks ago. He and I go way way back. So after a few minutes of   chit chat, Junie made his pitch and asked this...

"Franz, ano bang magandang business"?

And this is what I replied to him...

"Are you kidding me? you are way more talented than me"! 

In fact, Junie is truly is such a talented person and I should be asking advice from him and not the other way around.
