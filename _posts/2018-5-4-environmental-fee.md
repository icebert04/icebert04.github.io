![Environmental](/images/Environmental Fee 2.jpg)

Me and my family went to Matabungkay in Lian Batangas just to swim on the beach. We knew before that there are some locals who setting up ropes for donation for their April fiesta.   
But now we were surprised that there is an 25.00 pesos Environmental Fee. And that is not for the entire group... it's Php 25.00 per head.
