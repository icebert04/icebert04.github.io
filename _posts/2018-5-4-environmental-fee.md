![Environmental](/images/Environmental Fee 2.jpg)

Me and my family went to Matabungkay in Lian Batangas just to swim on the beach. We knew before that there are some locals who setting up ropes for donation for their April fiesta.   
But now we were surprised that there is an 25.00 pesos Environmental Fee. And that is not for the entire group... it's Php 25.00 per head.

I mean there is no problem paying up the fee but my concern is... 
1.) Does it have to be Php 25.00 per head.   
2.) Are the Collected environmental fees will be put transparently into a general fund that will be used for improvement of tourism infrastructure.

According to the municipial of Lian Batangas, a population of 50,000 residents, that they will implement collection of the said fees for the protection of their beach, their tourism, and their town.
