![Strangers](/images/Talk To Strangers.jpg)


When is the last time you talked to a stranger? Was it yesterday? last month? 3 years ago? or never?   
Would you mind telling me the reason why? Are you afraid of them? Or you just prefer to be with your close friends and family?   
Tell me... I'm really curious!

Me on the other hand wants to see a stranger every chance I get. Strangers to me are like Coins the the Nintendo Mario Bros video game. I try to get as many coins as I want.   
Why?   
My answer is this.... "Every individual has one unique story to tell that you could apply in your daily life"!

I give one scenario. I swim regularly. But I just don't go out and swim, take a shower and head back home. I always check if there is people around. And believe me, there are always people around.   

Like this guy in the picture in a yellow shirt. He is our pool maintenance guy! Only a few people talk to him. He just sits there all alone in his chair.   
I took the time to get to know him.... what could go wrong.
