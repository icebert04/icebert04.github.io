![Strangers](/images/Talk To Strangers.jpg)


When is the last time you talked to a stranger? Was it yesterday? last month? 3 years ago? or never?   
Would you mind telling me the reason why? Are you afraid of them? Or you just prefer to be with your close friends and family?   
Tell me... I'm really curious!

Me on the other hand wants to see a stranger every chance I get. Strangers to me are like Coins the the Nintendo Mario Bros video game. I try to get as many coins as I want.   
Why?   
My answer is this.... "Every individual has one unique story to tell that you could apply in your daily life"!
