![Strangers](/images/Talk To Strangers.jpg)


When is the last time you talked to a stranger? Was it yesterday? last month? 3 years ago? or never?   
Would you mind telling me the reason why? Are you afraid of them? Or you just prefer to be with your close friends and family?   
Tell me... I'm really curious!
