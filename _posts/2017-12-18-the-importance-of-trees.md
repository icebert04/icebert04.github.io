![Importance Of Trees](/images/Santolan 2.jpg)

My Greatgrandmother and Grandmother planted 90+ Carabao Mango Trees, 20+ Indian Mango Trees, 40+ Santolan Trees, and multiple Mahogany Trees in most of their properties in Balayan Batangas.   
So basically, we lived in a generation we were lived and stayed in a place with perfectly good shade, abundants of fruits and several trees to climb.
