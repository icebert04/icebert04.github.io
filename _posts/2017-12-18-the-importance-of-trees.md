![Importance Of Trees](/images/Santolan 2.jpg)

My late Greatgrandmother and Grandmother planted 90+ Carabao Mango Trees, 20+ Indian Mango Trees, 40+ Santolan Trees, and multiple Mahogany Trees in most of their properties in Balayan Batangas.   
So basically, we lived in a generation we were lived and stayed in a place with perfectly good shade, abundants of fruits and several trees to climb. 

It was so serene and peaceful that we do see different species of birds building their nest egg in one of the tall trees scattered in the property.   
We don't feel the heat even in the Summer and we never used aircondtioning. A typical electric fan will sufiice. When we were little we bring a pail of water at noon to build sand castle, pots and other sand stuff and we never ever perspire.   
We always climb trees (just the small ones) and watch the new bird hatchlings (normally pigeons). On very rare occassions, I sometimes saw a Black-naped Oriole built a nest to lay her eggs. It was an incredible experience.

Plus the fruits... we got loads and loads of them packed in large bamboo baskets (we call them Kaing). And since the mangoes are bountiful, my Grandmother (we call her Tita Caring) normally gave them away to relatives and friends.   
But suprisingly, we still got lots of mangoes (both green and yellow ones) everywhere in our house... like in the refrigerator, kumidor (Comedor in Spanish - dining room), the dirty kitchen and even in the lanai.   
We got so many mangoes the I gave up on eating them. They were just too many! 

I was so lucky that I was born in that kind of family. That even most of that properties that I've mentioned are long gone.... I still have one property that is filled with Mahogany trees and I do still intend to add more trees in the coming years. Not for me really but for my children, our relatives, and to our next generation.
