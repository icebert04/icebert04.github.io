Yes ladies, Don't get married yet. Enjoy the life of being single first. Don't be in a rush to marry the man of your dreams. Or have the baby of your own. That will come in due time.
Rather, enjoy relish the privilege of being a **"Bachelorette"**. The life of little responsibilites, bounteous travel & adventures, and more importantly.... total **"Freedom"**!

Cassandra (not her real name), who is in this picture, is a friend of mine based in Tokyo. She is also a Web Developer like me and enjoys the perks of flexible working hours and the potential earning.   
She left her parents after graduation and immediately got a promising job in Japan. Everything was doing well for Cassandra. Her career, her adventure for new food discovery and yes.... her love life.   
That is the reason why I didn't declare her real name because she has a over jealous boyfriend. 

My friend probably could be tying the knot this year right..... Eeennkkk, WRONG!!!!   
Marriage is in her mind.... well, not yet.   
Cassandra wants to travel, see the different cultures, broaden her horizons and create memories of a lifetime. And so she did exactly that. She travelled to countries in South East Asia, and now in Europe. 

The last time that we talked she was in Prague checking on the hidden attractions, cool sights, and unusual things in the capital. She really had fun travelling and intends to travel to other countries.

Sadly, that is not the case in the Philippines. 1 in 10 young Filipino women (age 15-19) is already a mother or pregnant with her first child. The Philippines has the third highest "**Teen Pregnancy**" rate and is the only country in the region where the rate is increasing.   
Factors such as Lack of Information, Early Menarche, and the Rise of the uncontrollable gadgets and online social networks are the primary reason why the problem continues to persist.

Girls in our country are stuch in "Disney World"! Like they live in a Fairy Tale land, where their Prince Charming will come rescue them from their Evil Parents.
