Yes ladies, Don't get married yet. Enjoy the life of being single first. Don't be in a rush to marry the man of your dreams. Or have the baby of your own. That will come in due time.
Rather, enjoy relish the privilege of being a Bachelorette. The life of little responsibilites, bounteous travel & adventures, and more importantly.... total "Freedom"!
