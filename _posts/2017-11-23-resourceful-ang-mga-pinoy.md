Meet Romy! A former appliance sales representative who is now currently unemployed. He is living with his sister together with his niece and nephew. His sister is the one who is working and pays the rent in the condominium that they are staying in the city of Para√±aque.   
Romy's sister provide all the basic necessities in their household including Romy's needs and a few of his little luxuries (Luho).   
A typical Filipino with a lifestyle like Romy would probably enjoy this kind of life. They may use the condominium's amenities like swimming pool, basketball and badminton courts. They can also drink alcoholic drinks while talking to their neighbors in the clubhouse. They have the option to stay in their condo unit the whole day watching TV and probably use the internet in order to play Facebook games.

Romy is not one of them.
