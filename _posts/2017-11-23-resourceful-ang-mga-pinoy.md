Meet **Romy**! A former appliance sales representative who is now currently unemployed. He is living with his sister together with his niece and nephew. His sister is the one who is working and pays the rent in the condominium that they are staying in the city of Para√±aque.   
Romy's sister provide all the basic necessities in their household including Romy's needs and a few of his little luxuries (Luho).   
A typical Filipino with a lifestyle like Romy would probably enjoy this kind of life. They may use the condominium's amenities like swimming pool, basketball and badminton courts. They can also drink alcoholic drinks while talking to their neighbors in the clubhouse. They have the option to stay in their condo unit the whole day watching TV and probably use the internet in order to play Facebook games.

Romy is not one of them. Aside from helping with the housechores like cooking, doing the grocery, cleaning the rooms, etc. Romy make it a point that his niece and nephew are properly being taken care of. He makes sure that they done their assignment in school and goes to bed on time.

But what I find really amazing is his **"Pleasurable Pastime"**, which to some people call it like "Occupation" or "Distraction".   
Romy provides **Car Wash** services to most of the unit owners and tenants living in the condominium.  He noticed that there were so many cars that were parked uncleaned by their owners. The owners vaguely doesn't have the spare time to clean their cars. Only a few unit owners has helpers (Yaya) in their unit because of the limited space (2 bedroom unit). So these owners only have time to clean their cars on the weekends. There are about 400+ unit owners and tenants living in the said condominium.   
Romy identified the **"Need"** so he matched it with a **"Solution"**.
