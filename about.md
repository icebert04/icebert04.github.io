Hi! My name is Francis Isberto. The Creator of Friendillion.

I'm a Writer, part-time Entrepreneur and a Content Marketing Consultant.

I built Friendillion primarily as my personal journal of gaining new friends. 

What I never expected was people started to like my posts and articles. They said it is inspiring and has somewhat changed their lives. 


## Here's why I started to become Popular 

Last March, I posted an article titled "THE THING CALLED MATERIALISM" on my Facebook page. That post went viral. 
That post reached 2,877,912 and 782,130 engagements.   
It gathered 27 thousand Likes, 3.1 thousand Comments, and 17 thousand Shares.   
I didnâ€™t pay anything nor used Facebook Ads. Everything is organic!

Then another article of mine went viral, and then another... and another.

That's when I realized that we have something special going around here.   
People are inspired. It somewhat kept their hopes up. In my own small way, I was able to help them with their lives.

Through that, I've discovered the real definition of Friendillion... Helping People!
