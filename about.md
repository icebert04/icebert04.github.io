Hi! My name is Francis Isberto. The Creator of Friendillion.

I'm a Writer, Serial Entrepreneur, and a Content Marketing Consultant.

I built Friendillion primarily as my personal journal of gaining new friends. 

What I never expected was people started to like my posts and articles. They said it is inspiring and has somewhat changed their lives. 


## The Day "Friendillion" became "Trending"! 

Last March 1, 2019... I posted an article titled "THE THING CALLED MATERIALISM" on my Facebook page. That post went viral.   
That post reached 2,877,912 and 782,130 engagements.   

It gathered 27,000 Likes, 3,100 Comments, and 17,000 Shares.   
I didnâ€™t pay anything nor used Facebook Ads. Everything is organic!

Then another article of mine went viral, and then another... and another.

That's when I realized that we have something special going around here.   
People are inspired. It somewhat kept their hopes up.   
In my own small way, I was able to help them with their lives.

Through that, I've discovered the real definition of Friendillion... Helping People!


## Why Help the Small?

Like them, I too started from scratch. I know how these small businesses feel when they are just starting out. Why they have the chance to get ahead in the race.  

My goal is to help these small SME's to grow their business through

```sh
$ Creating Quality Content on their Facebook Page
$ Get their Customers Hook-up & Engaged
$ Generate more Repetitive Sales
```

     
My strengths lie in "Building Relationships".  
Healthy business relationships are the foundation of any successful business. 

Your Customers will love you. Influencers will align with you. And Competitors will become friends.
