I'm living a happy life! Blessed with a loving wife and 2 obedient boys. 
As a Full Stack Developer I get to work on the comforts on my home and spend more time with my Siamese Cat and play NBA2K.
I love outdoor sports and go swimming regularly.

But now, I want to add more things in my life... particularly gaining new friends.

Are you willing to be one of them?
